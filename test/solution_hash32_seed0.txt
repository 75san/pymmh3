PREFACE
0x4D81649C

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
0x78CC7258
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
0xDEBB4453
miscellaneous remark.
0x9FC4B2AA

0xDB06C2B2
My thanks are due in three quarters.
0x554B4106

0xDB06C2B2
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
0x25B9A3CE
few pretensions.
0x2D79B29A

0xDB06C2B2
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
0x9D72C331
obscure aspirant.
0xE6475658

0xDB06C2B2
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
0x108E5BF6
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
0xBB4A4B09
Author.
0x5D435579

0xDB06C2B2
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
0x42FE6F84
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
0x4A248E5C
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
0x3CCC92A7
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
0x6C3522A2
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
0x8E51CBE5
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
0xF7EAAFE9

0xDB06C2B2
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
0x7BFB6CA1
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
0xE46BC8F4
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
0x8298B6F3
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
0xDA74B7B9
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
0x79440A3F
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
0x774100F1
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
0x80D6C153
would remind them of certain simple truths.
0xBD71F3A1

0xDB06C2B2
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
0x34505DE2
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
0x461D65A0
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
0xFC6F4C3B
Thorns.
0x25439A03

0xDB06C2B2
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
0xABFED94C
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
0xF4B62245
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
0xE4035CEC
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
0xB6AF56AC
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
0xBD3DA84F
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
0x2D6D6AB4
and clearly the line of separation between them.
0x74D7E26E

0xDB06C2B2
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
0x3E321157
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
0x5B667ACB
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
0x6C421C45
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
0xE1390244
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
0x1ADB7B23
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
0x51C012FF

0xDB06C2B2
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
0x9FFB8A71
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
0x0282B5AC
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
0x6976A11C
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
0x7560E196

0xDB06C2B2
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
0x86F4DB4F
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
0xDB87457D
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
0xE069BB62
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
0x5C2FCF60
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
0xEB9496E5
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
0x4856BCF8
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
0xF2447FF2
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
0xD50CE552
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
0x294AFD1E
Rimoth-Gilead.
0x88BB7518

0xDB06C2B2
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
0x23F156F6
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
0xC62462EC
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
0x24881878
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
0xF42CCE16
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
0x788DE05E
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
0xA7877229
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
0x51B6427E
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
0x260CCE4B
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
0xABAF6D1A
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
0xDED82E80
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
0x9110E37F
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
0x06AD24E7
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
0x30AD0F7D
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
0x5E96AE63
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
0xEFEBDFE6

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
0xEF853832
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
0x14650CAB
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
0x0BDD5BAA
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
0xF6B8D8F7
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
0x1AA331E8
denied where it is justly due.
0x1D364FB5

0xDB06C2B2
This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have
0xBA249D38
been made, and to prevent future errors.

CHAPTER I
0x8BFE0DC3

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
0x58C66A75
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
0x98CD28BC
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
0x05B3D428
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
0xB05D79C2
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
0x84F541A8

0xDB06C2B2
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
0x2CFEAE04
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
0x4248004D
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
0xC79D0317
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
0x6FB9B9A4
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
0xB3B1AC41

0xDB06C2B2
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
0xAC5686AE
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
0xE4F89F6D
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
0xEF08F932
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
0xAB26E523
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
0x56B9CE04
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
0xAD1755DF
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
0x2FD457DF
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
0x9BA7A867
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
0x2CEE5C51
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
0x95517F50
little children."
0x69E8B48D

0xDB06C2B2
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
0x0E20191A

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
0x971E8AF7
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
0xD5AD5EDD
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
0xB9FB9D5C

0xDB06C2B2
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
0x5FE7097A
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
0xBEDDF6DD
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
0x7F5795BC
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
0x1248D587
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
0x348F492E
retirement.
0x56584F2D

0xDB06C2B2
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
0x278F212F
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
0x502F6BB4
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
0x3C7A83E8
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
0xA2F369D7
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
0x566A4DC8
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
0x32411B70
lamentable blast.
0x6789451A

0xDB06C2B2
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
0x46BB07B3
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
0x4D502519
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
0x95663E0A
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
0x90E009CA
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
0x755FBD57
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
0x13BABC5C
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
0x05A39C62

0xDB06C2B2
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
0x12CC8F73
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
0x5C7A2D49
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
0x2E4D668E
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
0x7597FB8C

0xDB06C2B2
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
0xA37272EA
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
0x431772AE
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
0x4DA249D2
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
0x34152F0E
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
0x8F38A05A
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
0x959B7F7E
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
0x399CB607
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
0xA4BAE028
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
0x29B87CAB
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
0x3C334BFB
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
0x3C9ABB1B
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
0x872EFD07
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
0xBF768DE5

0xDB06C2B2
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
0x3D28C2E4
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
0xC153ED2A
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
0xF52284DF
hour of eventide.
0x40A92D24

0xDB06C2B2
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
0x45F070D8

0xDB06C2B2
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
0x3CE25EC9
quickly: it was an object of terror.
0x81E1FCCD

0xDB06C2B2
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
0x1DCFE367
crowd surrounding a gallows.
0x41B472EA

0xDB06C2B2
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
0x8021F731
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
0xE9930259
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
0x98636F74
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
0x99EC6541
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
0x6CCA6311
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
0x715FD9E0
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
0x4D49642D
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
0x12FB726F
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
0xF9C7429C

0xDB06C2B2
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
0xEE87F50D
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
0x0EDC22C3
room door opened.
0x36649F43

0xDB06C2B2
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
0xE59FF4CC
found the room apparently empty.
0x9C09DA05

0xDB06C2B2
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
0x19A9A06C
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
0x80BE49C5
animal!"
0x58B98A1D

0xDB06C2B2
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
0x6158B96B
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
0x90E26D34
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
0xCDE4AFFC
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
0x44D27205

0xDB06C2B2
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
0x02429491

0xDB06C2B2
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
0x19A9D830
forth by the said Jack.
0x52E73F67

0xDB06C2B2
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
0xE5E41BFC

0xDB06C2B2
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
0x9537C0EE
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
0xFA9002A2
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
0xEEAC0217

0xDB06C2B2
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
0x6BD25B3C
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
0x00A9C540
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
0x5A751C8A
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
0x62F666E6
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
0xBB17F86E
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
0x01B843CC
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
0x3655212E
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
0x71949C12
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
0x25425DF2
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
0x5F6AC1E1
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
0x3ABAFB4B
home.
0x1B5E5549

0xDB06C2B2
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
0xEA9E6E63
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
0xC1FCC1C2
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
0x36B66B7C
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
0x8547C31F
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
0x62A005D9
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
0xBCEA0E6F
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
0x5E9FC0DA
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
0x78BFF9EF
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
0x0CF04FC0
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
0x3F554D50
her back.
0x3DAC9E65

0xDB06C2B2
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
0xAB52D73D
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
0xC3B1A49D
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
0x08726F9B
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
0x033E17B2
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
0x5C2CF452
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
0x0683EE46
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
0x416260C1
chair.
0xFFA46BE2

0xDB06C2B2
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
0xFB3ADC0D
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
0x930FE12D
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
0xC51D6538

0xDB06C2B2
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
0x63A7D2E3
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
0xD3D32C94
insult.
0x8C118A73

0xDB06C2B2
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
0xAC98BDFE

0xDB06C2B2
"I was reading."
0x4911312A

0xDB06C2B2
"Show the book."
0x64FEA2F8

0xDB06C2B2
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
0xC88BE36B

0xDB06C2B2
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
0x44846E76
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
0x9D83E0CE
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
0xB8FF82C5
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
0xD88E6CE5
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
0x6E51A6A9
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
0x68A926B3
the mirror and the windows."
0x0FA70EF5

0xDB06C2B2
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
0xECA998B3
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
0xA2E47C62
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
0x1AE204AD
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
0x5DDAC24B
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
0x66DDF616
climax; other feelings succeeded.
0xC2141B7C

0xDB06C2B2
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
0xB24C4935
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
0x59B4F2D4

0xDB06C2B2
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
0x30AA0F77
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
0xFCC10A3F
thought thus to have declared aloud.
0xEFE67D67

0xDB06C2B2
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
0xFA5DF025
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
0xBE85C922

0xDB06C2B2
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
0xF94BF7A4
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
0x2992E837
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
0x743F1B72
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
0x1E282288
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
0x17219657
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
0x21ABB61D
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
0xBD596953
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
0xB7C2EBE2
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
0xFA96F81E

0xDB06C2B2
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
0x4A37D593

0xDB06C2B2
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
0xCCAE080E

0xDB06C2B2
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
0x53A0E4ED

0xDB06C2B2
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
0x3E91F8D6
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
0x14F645ED

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
CHAPTER II
0x69726110

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
0x1281C0B9
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
0xF200D6C2
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
0x41296904
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
0x57CCFE70
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
0xFBE5CB89
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
0xA7F6C6F8

0xDB06C2B2
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
0xA8E66DDE

0xDB06C2B2
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
0x85D59F95
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
0x24E8A9F5
young master."
0xBF452DAE

0xDB06C2B2
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
0x714A87D6

0xDB06C2B2
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
0x87B1DD6C
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
0xDD2BF6D4

0xDB06C2B2
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
0x8577B957
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
0xEBB139B3
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
0x2C7D45A5

0xDB06C2B2
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
0x0A249FA0
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
0x16E97D3E

0xDB06C2B2
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
0x6DB4D551
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
0x4D59D311
little of the excitement out of me.
0x2F3F14A0

0xDB06C2B2
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
0x482ADC0A

0xDB06C2B2
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
0xB524EE01

0xDB06C2B2
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
0xE46FB47B
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
0xE3160282
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
0xEEA133B1
incredulous of my sanity.
0x384E3523

0xDB06C2B2
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
0xDBDA1EDA

0xDB06C2B2
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
0x94E0C3E1
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
0x465A45BF
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
0xD75413A9

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
0x7E2D9F6B
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
0x225CF69B
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
0xDF3A7AF5

0xDB06C2B2
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
0xF7EEAF7B
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
0xC4AE5F8D
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
0xA2DB6016
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
0xFF99E9CA

0xDB06C2B2
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
0x9D7D88F1
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
0xDC2EE0CE
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
0x3F92EC6A
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
0xAE3ED29B
them."
0x56A340B7

0xDB06C2B2
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
0xB5647301
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
0x0BF6AB51
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
0xE3E6F0E4
away, I am sure."
0x8DFE786E

0xDB06C2B2
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
0x955765BC
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
0xD9935F56
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
0xC810A388
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
0x00CBAD94
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
0xD369408F
fetch you away."
0x7F9DAC44

0xDB06C2B2
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
0x3815D0B3

0xDB06C2B2
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
0x4EA2F7E5
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
0x1BD43605
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
0x279E0EDB
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
0xB83E09AE
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
0xAF814413
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
0xC9C6BA49
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
0xE2B9687D
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
0x7BD57E9A
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
0xEB698873
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
0x90175B66
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
0x6E094DB4
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
0x510DB278
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
0x51B88FDF
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
0x6393B7C6
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
0x68B461FD
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
0xF87EF1AE

0xDB06C2B2
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
0xBF30DBCA
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
0x0BD0E430
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
0xC0A7B481
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
0x31230FF1
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
0x2C5D2719
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
0x534BA1D2
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
0x32452D60
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
0x252FDA6D
in spite of its grandeur.
0x536AF805

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
0x96386A6A
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
0x0EE975C4
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
0xDB630053
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
0x348A9A44

0xDB06C2B2
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
0x0FBB0E78
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
0xF848D36D
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
0xC572645B
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
0x980DC684
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
0x74F8C5F1
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
0x3F89F197
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
0x3B5EBCDE
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
0x5835D2AB
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
0xFA06B7A2
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
0x118F92A8
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
0xBF1A60F1
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
0x01125D3F
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
0xB2D18A74
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
0x9A3CCCB5
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
0x949AAE0C
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
0x95014277

0xDB06C2B2
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
0xB065C3B9
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
0x292C4416
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
0xE92AA121
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
0xC7FF00F1

0xDB06C2B2
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
0x3AE35137
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
0x95015944
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
0xA2747D99
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
0xFD3D2F1A
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
0x860BB0BF
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
0xC0894444
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
0x7417ADC8
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
0x82111D39
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
0xAF549488
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
0xCA8598A4
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
0x34338D18
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
0xE46CCBBC
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
0x291F2B52
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
0x648B9FB9
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
0x01B58066
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
0xB973F81B
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
0xC44E7F46
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
0x354BCE87
night.
0x8D14E5D1

0xDB06C2B2
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
0x0CEE3BA2
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
0x16B794E1
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
0x69EDEFF7
general opprobrium.
0x58CB41E7

0xDB06C2B2
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
0x65256AA9
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
0x619BBDF1
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
0x3D82B1C4
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
0x7D82C598
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
0xCB4C02FF

0xDB06C2B2
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
0x213A2234
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
0x0B072875
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
0xB9390437
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
0x37AB6EFB
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
0xB4F42F44

0xDB06C2B2
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
0xF5BC6E4E
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
0xDFBA7A30
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
0xFB2AB11F
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
0x589BAC49
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
0xAAD469AD
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
0xDC95A3C4
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
0x965501C3
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
0xA53B6D53
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
0x27392A81
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
0x11D7AB2B
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
0x98C54C1C
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
0x0318CC5F
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
0x2892713B

0xDB06C2B2
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
0x7B9A0D6C
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
0x1E9028E4
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
0x90A7ED1B
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
0x0A4EDB1A
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
0xA84C0EE8
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
0x9B982250
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
0xFC8A1DF5
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
0xF92758B2
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
0x35395B66
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
0xB7B38D63
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
0xD7AB17A8
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
0xDF4D4112
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
0x3B163226
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
0x74E1CE74
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
0x65D82A08
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
0x56366CD2
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
0xD792E677
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
0x09457132
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
0x518F8104
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
0xDD8B57E8
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
0x2B7821F6
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
0x68992AA2

0xDB06C2B2
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
0x482374DC
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
0x743F3372
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
0x8CF14378
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
0x5B8861DD
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
0x259D3C45
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
0x25CCB66B
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
0x641C914B
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
0x4CA65893
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
0x95EE3F80
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
0xB52267E5
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
0xB693BEAF
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
0x6FCBE084
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
0xDAF14EF2
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
0x489E4DE2
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
0x62E02056
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
0x6A064358
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
0xD0C5A5D8
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
0x647AAD2D
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
0xBF1A8804
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
0x0BDBC448
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
0x06C5F015
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
0xF4E96C67
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
0x17705170
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
0x6670D9EA
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
0xD9803FDB
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
0xF3ED68E6
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
0xA1D02713
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
0xDBF1A938
Abbot entered.
0x2CF8852E

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
0x0499677D

0xDB06C2B2
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
0x5E1B5E45

0xDB06C2B2
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
0xDB37B8B1

0xDB06C2B2
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
0xF2B85963
Bessie.
0x32B37E0A

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
0x07E24209
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
0x166D95A6

0xDB06C2B2
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
0x53B542B3
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
0x64AB465A
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
0x610D8060

0xDB06C2B2
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
0x97B55A9D
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
0xD93797EE
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
0x88CD965A
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
0x2149DEF1

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
0x69435AAD

0xDB06C2B2
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
0x12B870CA
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
0xE415FF16
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
0x7F24B8C7
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
0x89351CC8
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
0x31AFC14A
then."
0x557C168B

0xDB06C2B2
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
0xA3841F72
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
0x84E16030

0xDB06C2B2
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
0xE8F2DC2F
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
0xDCE49B67
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
0x4492214D
duplicity.
0x2520A4F4

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
0x0A3DB3B5
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
0x2C9182B0
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
0xF30FA0C1
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.

CHAPTER III
0x3ADDC329

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
0xA1E7A3A2
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
0x7AA6A5DD
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
0x9F28B982
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
0x81CAC40B
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
0xDD0A31AC
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
0xA9C632F3
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
0x7140897B
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
0x03BAEAAA
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
0x6A18987D

0xDB06C2B2
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
0x238320B7
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
0x4481FB81
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
0x05BF26E2
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
0xA8249EF6
pillow, leaning over me.
0x9FED9CA6

0xDB06C2B2
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
0xFDCD3541
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
0x96E6DFB3
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
0x3E6DD681
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
0xF8EE2966
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
0x7B6946A8
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
0xFEDDDA19
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
0x8C7A740D
herself and the children she employed a physician.
0x19B7391E

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
0xF3FDA074

0xDB06C2B2
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
0x4F23539C
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
0xA2D2FB2A
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
0xF5FA3129
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
0x85F4A8A2
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
0x02E33D07
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
0x27DEB2E2
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
0xC0C86135
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
0xE9673E9C

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
0x0BB09A4D

0xDB06C2B2
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
0x14892A0D
rough.  "I will try."
0x27E10295

0xDB06C2B2
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
0x348B5113

0xDB06C2B2
"No, thank you, Bessie."
0xD864723B

0xDB06C2B2
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
0x8082DB75
may call me if you want anything in the night."
0x36AC83D0

0xDB06C2B2
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
0x23BC567D

0xDB06C2B2
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
0xA3491415

0xDB06C2B2
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
0x4AD3956A
soon, no doubt."
0x16CC3DB9

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
0xC99A2E32
say--
0x1A4DE507

0xDB06C2B2
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
0x23ECED3E
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
0x546911C6
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
0x9E8F5FEC
rather too hard."
0x3408E372

0xDB06C2B2
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
0xF36555EF
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
0x59FFAB9B
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
0xD9D2D0C7
the main subject discussed.
0x14525E04

0xDB06C2B2
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
0x6D8BAFFA
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
0xB734AE80
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
0x2D3FD342

0xDB06C2B2
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
0xF5C763B0
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
0x20AE2DBD
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
0x4F7B6487

0xDB06C2B2
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
0x0E930B0A
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
0xA95856C5
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
0xFE8B7512
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
0x9A2ECCA5
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
0xC196F78F
bad propensities.
0x0E26C2FA

0xDB06C2B2
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
0x39EDB950
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
0x03E4875A
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
0xEF94BC0E
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
0x90D294BD
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
0x3BB9CED4
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
0xC66B6F06
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
0x2423F484
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
0xE50EE102
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
0x2EB620EA
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
0xC5021083
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
0xB31CB175
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
0xCF22E90D
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
0xDF9424F6

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
0xACABDDEA
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
0x82F1FEEA
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
0xFEAC8369
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
0x6A1422D6
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
0xD985D2F4
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
0x9667D223
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
0x5839A686
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
0xC38FB221
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
0xF2163CCC
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
0xDFD003B3
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
0x4E49F13E
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
0xF7B67E32
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
0xEB79D401
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
0x03DB0235
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
0x9ED86249
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
0xA94AFB8F
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
0x7012F70F
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
0x7F81A8C9
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
0x0478D6C3
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
0x659491C3
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
0x91B79646
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
0x1605D03E
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
0x413A816D
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
0x93267D45
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
0x7BF3A068
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
0xAF525C02
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
0xC8AF4346
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
0x70A49360
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
0xFF1C3EFF
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
0xE7B54AA6
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
0xF95F47B3
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
0x3B4FA46D
untasted tart.
0xB0899C33

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
0x6CF561AD
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
0xCFE9F0E8
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
0xC58F95FA
Meantime she sang: her song was--
0x9789C749

0xDB06C2B2
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
0xD737A052
      A long time ago."
0x4661B498

0xDB06C2B2
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
0x350CEB32
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
0xDFA815B0
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
0x91BEC4F6
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
0xF429DD7F
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
0xFC45A67E
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
0x4372B5EC
one.
0x336468C3

0xDB06C2B2
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
0x3F6116B1
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
0xA15563CC
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
0x24FA7BB6
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
0xFB9D1200

0xDB06C2B2
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
0x66F293C2
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
0xE3B224FD
   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
0x8E754B45
      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
0xF1D8871B

0xDB06C2B2
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
0x3943F1D9
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
0x86C43330
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
0x916E6767
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
0xA9B54B81

0xDB06C2B2
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
0xC08D44FD
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
0x2C840C6C
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
0xD4E510AE
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
0x24636527

0xDB06C2B2
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
0x3BEFAC51
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
0x33E6EAFA
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
0x13BF8CB5
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
0x335096E9

0xDB06C2B2
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
0x7D77ABC3
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
0x5A89F331
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
0x64A73B50
Lloyd came again.
0x864EC8AE

0xDB06C2B2
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
0x9DD084F2
how is she?"
0x46A052E5

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
0xA09C0A9B

0xDB06C2B2
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
0x074ACED7
is Jane, is it not?"
0x252B6EBD

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
0x79BA1A41

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
0x1D80040A
Have you any pain?"
0xC9112817

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir."
0x3690D484

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in
0xBCB4D768
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
0xEBD48E8A

0xDB06C2B2
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
0x433F344F

0xDB06C2B2
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
0xAC9C13B2
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
0x66E1AC53
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
0xEBE8B292

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
0x4C9365E5

0xDB06C2B2
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
0xE54BBC77
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
0x614ABAD9
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
0xC107C312
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
0xD8BD5766
leisure, he said--
0xC7ADC6E5

0xDB06C2B2
"What made you ill yesterday?"
0xCB8A31EF

0xDB06C2B2
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
0x4D75D587

0xDB06C2B2
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
0x22BC6FAD
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
0xA15BA238

0xDB06C2B2
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
0x4F7A1634
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
0x25512F87
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
0xD239E73A

0xDB06C2B2
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
0xE8C72BCE
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
0xAA3CE1F3
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
0x918ADC8D

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
0xC98B9C56
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
0xCA600A0B

0xDB06C2B2
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
0x4822773D
Bessie was gone.
0xDBEDF805

0xDB06C2B2
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
0x9D4B10C3

0xDB06C2B2
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
0xF2A07E3E

0xDB06C2B2
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
0xB248CCF2

0xDB06C2B2
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
0x858634AE
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
0x08DDFD0D
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
0xB9CB13FD
that I think I shall never forget it."
0xF1980309

0xDB06C2B2
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in
0xB5839C33
daylight?"
0x3CF112BD

0xDB06C2B2
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
0xE54FAFBE
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
0x25C2A6C0

0xDB06C2B2
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
0x7035A243

0xDB06C2B2
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
0xD7C763C3
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
0xF6C36DA8
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
0xEB24F802
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
0xB19D0419
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
0x6639A9C2
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
0x26362A87
though, as far as it went, true response.
0x931756A7

0xDB06C2B2
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
0x509C5384

0xDB06C2B2
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
0x18E64A54

0xDB06C2B2
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
0x0A523056

0xDB06C2B2
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
0x66F0B30C

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
0xD40FE9C3

0xDB06C2B2
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
0xC1E85C5E
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
0xF0679ABF

0xDB06C2B2
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
0x4956EC67
than a servant."
0x383887B3

0xDB06C2B2
"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"
0xC51D91C5

0xDB06C2B2
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
0x791D5889
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
0x7A1F337C

0xDB06C2B2
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
0x43EE6BF9

0xDB06C2B2
"I think not, sir."
0x7F9C9759

0xDB06C2B2
"None belonging to your father?"
0x435AA819

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
0x0ED14FEE
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
0x1FE2716C
them."
0x56A340B7

0xDB06C2B2
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
0x7A8F83EC

0xDB06C2B2
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
0xDD6F0D8E
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
0xB3324C33
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
0xE86CA1CF
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
0x8E0B99ED
for me was synonymous with degradation.
0x98881DD2

0xDB06C2B2
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
0x4B4F8156

0xDB06C2B2
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
0x19DF90E3

0xDB06C2B2
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
0x56B6F2AA
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
0x6A679477
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
0x19461427
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
0x90D429D2
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
0xD342248D
the price of caste.
0xCA57BC4F

0xDB06C2B2
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
0x43854A7E

0xDB06C2B2
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
0x95CCF621
set: I should not like to go a begging."
0xE09D720F

0xDB06C2B2
"Would you like to go to school?"
0x2509566B

0xDB06C2B2
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
0xA69A1E2E
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
0xFFA5A523
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
0x896E0389
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
0x8296882F
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
0x6E591694
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
0xD6D62C95
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
0x3FC45C5B
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
0x8C631706
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
0xDA6EBF09
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
0x8AB35C50
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
0x8E9B99BE
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
0x57059D45
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
0xA313A6B5
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
0xB3D47F98

0xDB06C2B2
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
0xF62B8945
musings.
0x9B785112

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
0xD4CE1468
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
0xAC804DF5
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
0x79429C54

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
0x1DF2DB60
the gravel-walk.
0x2A0A35C6

0xDB06C2B2
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
0xD62E1F0B
to her before I go."
0x5D21F10C

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
0xFCD69B82
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
0xE6F5E1E5
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
0xCE311EB7
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
0x66DCCCB7
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
0x540B67C7
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
0x27C47D33
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
0x4F1ACC55
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
0x07D8D929
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
0x53E8E486
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
0x75C16265

0xDB06C2B2
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
0xED1B979A
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
0xB6F22D49
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
0x8159F7C5
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
0x03609814
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
0x90C70223
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
0x37F5F651
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
0xCDC16CAB
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
0x653EB82A
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
0x686CF55B
of each other.
0x807A0421

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
0x6BE5F603
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
0x5CE4845B

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
0x0686C125
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
0x77CC0057
little toad as that."
0x5612A85D

0xDB06C2B2
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
0xCCFF2699
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
0x1A921FFC

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
0x586405B5
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
0xB74A9F7D
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
0xD59E2E10
rabbit for supper."
0x11919D7A

0xDB06C2B2
"So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down."  They went.
0x68C5FDA6

0xDB06C2B2
CHAPTER IV
0x02711C58

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
0x993367A7
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
0x361E96F7
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
0xA67B0099
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
0x7C303F44
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
0x5D1BBE81
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
0xCB763AD3
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
0x38CE2A8D
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
0x4757C77C
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
0xA1557F81
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
0x260FD2B1
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
0x9DB300AA
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
0x9C49CA97
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
0x6763742C
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
0x302731D2
and rooted aversion.
0xBA0074E4

0xDB06C2B2
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
0x457B23FE
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
0xB282DB3B
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
0xFBE457FD
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
0x43FE5771
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
0x638B11B3
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
0x9A83D741
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
0xFC9132B6
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
0xE59FBB76
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
0x645B020E
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
0xC3E35A2A
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
0x217FF6D6
was stopped rather harshly--
0x26D6D091

0xDB06C2B2
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
0xCFB222EF
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
0x3DEF1DAD
should associate with her."
0xAB8E4F2A

0xDB06C2B2
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
0xC82CC434
deliberating on my words--
0x99F76258

0xDB06C2B2
"They are not fit to associate with me."
0x99CF742A

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
0xC867E16B
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
0x59567917
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
0x8664364C
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
0xB717C262
syllable during the remainder of the day.
0x7D8D2414

0xDB06C2B2
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
0x19B01B18
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
0x87F7882C
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
0x6B938778
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
0x1C5AD307

0xDB06C2B2
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
0xF3E5CE12
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
0xC04C285E
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
0xDD858502
fiend.  I was now in for it.
0xB47A38CE

0xDB06C2B2
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
0xC5109594
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
0xAECA01B0
wish me dead."
0xEA60F4AC

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
0x7B0F00A5
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
0xA4ADCEBA
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
0x79E65F3F
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
0x6FF2CDE2
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
0x1D1F76D3
in my breast.
0x4F667984

0xDB06C2B2
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
0x4C51DA54
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
0x0005F4F9
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
0xF8604D75
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
0xE62D73B9
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
0x2E09FC80
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
0xD44DAE20
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
0x88D2F652
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
0x03913D82
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
0x76EE06B5
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
0x4545DD2D
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
0x12171089
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
0x501D8990
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
0xA1D6B76D
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
0x8978497E
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
0xE5B7CFCD
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
0xC02596FC
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
0x0FDA5D0E
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
0xEC8E7D0D
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
0x2FFE72F5
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
0xC1649B4D
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
0x1A6AB34C
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
0x332FBBFB
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
0x350154B2
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
0xA09DF1E7
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
0x2802ABDA
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
0x5E2E6E97
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
0x4BB1733C
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
0xE386607B
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
0x644E6603
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
0x870614DB
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
0x9BE29C7D
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
0xD0D82495
to be happy likewise.
0xCC5F6BB8

0xDB06C2B2
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
0xED071F4C
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
0xA9E8B4F7
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
0x8D6786E8
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
0x93E29EF1
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
0x91E55001
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
0x0FEAE09F
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
0x2B5F07EC
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
0xB5BF7F61
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
0x2C2005CA
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
0xD092DF56
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
0xE51CBA54
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
0xF2206025
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
0x6B019A2F
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
0xFFD85FFC
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
0xDAC9BDB3
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
0xF0F06D8E
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
0xCAFB5AA4
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
0x010ED53B
Gateshead Hall.
0x72EE9862

0xDB06C2B2
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
0xD654FD1B
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
0x78A816BD
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
0x733CEB92
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
0x78F7EB2D
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
0x17145D47
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
0x6357FF55
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
0x118F4B62
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
0x637AC0EB
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
0x9E4E4F4A
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
0x3322B15E
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
0x9D513A34
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
0x26A885AB
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
0xD8FA59EC
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
0x086A063D
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
0x8C815307
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
0xC57F2FB8
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
0x263449DF
accuracy.
0x878E2FB2

0xDB06C2B2
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
0x254223E5
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
0x5581A1CB
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
0xFE9BBE46
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
0xB6B1E75B
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
0x5C1133EB
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
0x154C162F
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
0xE7311C69
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
0xEAECEFE2
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
0x2D58AD48
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
0xBE3E7F03
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
0x7CFAE8B1
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
0x57138943
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
0x0FF8CE2E
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
0x127A1C6B
frost.
0x7BAEB12D

0xDB06C2B2
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
0xFC860871
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
0x6AA976E3
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
0xA1796A9B
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
0xDF8B27BD
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
0xD2C3E541
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
0x6727018C
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
0xE93D4136
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
0x65A85700
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
0x7A0E0B5C
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
0x9BC69903
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
0x86172BF6
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
0xEAE01809
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
0x40746BC7
nursery.
0xB02CB3F0

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
0xBD971EB0
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
0x8CAA765C
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
0x3AB94AA3
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
0x050CB8B8
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
0x1004711B

0xDB06C2B2
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
0xF6732024

0xDB06C2B2
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
0xD1587F63
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
0x52BDE9AA
window for?"
0x4349E05D

0xDB06C2B2
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
0x7EC85EEC
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
0x57607480
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
0x0843EADE
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
0x88D62D50
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
0xB834A53A
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
0x33C941F0

0xDB06C2B2
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
0x7647F7BA
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
0x1BC62B2B
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
0x22C86635
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
0xC49100B3
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
0x5E0D072E
which it dismayed me to intrude.
0xD9E900D5

0xDB06C2B2
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
0xC6696B66
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
0xABEB380E
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
0xBF21B29B
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
0xDFC574A7
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
0xF67E75CD
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
0x50CB42E2

0xDB06C2B2
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
0xBABBD6D3
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
0xE5A03AFC
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
0xE51F95B6
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
0x289F2160
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
0x1CE533B8
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
0x7602EE4B
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
0x2277459B
by way of capital.
0x51FF2DDD

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
0x7952512D
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
0x1862505F
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
0xF63E328D
you."
0xEED23204

0xDB06C2B2
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
0xC822D1ED
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
0x55F6CAF8
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
0x56EE27BB
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
0x420EC36F

0xDB06C2B2
"Ten years."
0xCB25B816

0xDB06C2B2
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
0x02E49500
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
0x15CEECD6

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane Eyre, sir."
0x7988C535

0xDB06C2B2
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
0xBB5A74B4
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
0x52DFC497
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
0xB94EFB80

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
0x399000B7

0xDB06C2B2
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
0x153EBF65
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
0x0A21F8B6
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
0x69594A8E
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x1EE1D13B

0xDB06C2B2
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
0xB188CCE8
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
0x175735D2
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
0x0C720796

0xDB06C2B2
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
0x7F7C079E
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
0x5F28B888
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
0x1533B595

0xDB06C2B2
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
0x13245DB6
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
0x2324A047

0xDB06C2B2
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
0xC556E75C

0xDB06C2B2
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
0xE737277D

0xDB06C2B2
"A pit full of fire."
0x39FF0566

0xDB06C2B2
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
0x6AF4A59E
ever?"

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir."
0x3690D484

0xDB06C2B2
"What must you do to avoid it?"
0x0BD3B951

0xDB06C2B2
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
0x4E4FCC99
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
0xCCBA3B70

0xDB06C2B2
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
0xAD4E56F5
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
0x41753613
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
0x531A1838
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
0xB7ABE801

0xDB06C2B2
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
0x76E80131
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
0x85359008
enough away.
0x61A73F7D

0xDB06C2B2
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
0x17B940A9
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
0x7195A664

0xDB06C2B2
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
0x48F72B33
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
0xC2FA2BE3

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
0xF08BD901

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you read your Bible?"
0x760C02FA

0xDB06C2B2
"Sometimes."
0xC7D3D2C5

0xDB06C2B2
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
0x861FDF8C

0xDB06C2B2
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
0xC5620F23
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
0xF4A9BBF0
and Jonah."
0x6B223FE5

0xDB06C2B2
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
0xA63083C3

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir."
0x3690D484

0xDB06C2B2
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
0xDD2F69D7
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
0x8EB16147
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
0x0011EF7A
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
0x34D96DCA
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
0x6229FD01
piety."
0x4BD17533

0xDB06C2B2
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
0x00BBB99E

0xDB06C2B2
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
0x7983E671
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
0x2F29DC89
give you a heart of flesh."
0xEFF1125C

0xDB06C2B2
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
0x03FDEBF6
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
0x27E6521F
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
0x1B4F8395
conversation herself.
0x2540B53B

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
0x2FC9B904
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
0xB5687337
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
0xC72059D1
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
0x6686346D
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
0x0AA5A9CA
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
0x7BF835DF
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x37240061

0xDB06C2B2
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
0x2AE4DBCC
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
0x97A77472
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
0xBD53D63B
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
0xD41931A7
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
0xD2E9A9E4
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
0x4AD93F59
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
0x2CC78B1E
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
0xAD250550
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
0xACB5895A
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
0xE192689C

0xDB06C2B2
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
0x516A7807
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
0xCCF822E7

0xDB06C2B2
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
0xA80777A1
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
0xEC8F4D4B
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
0xBD109E72
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
0xF05DA457

0xDB06C2B2
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
0xF29199BD
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
0x5D439735
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
0x16FFE6CF
Lowood."
0xF15A1ED9

0xDB06C2B2
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
0xD19718AC
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
0xA01EC212
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
0x2E27B897
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
0x6A62EAA3
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
0xBA679B92
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
0x63A5DF66
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
0x98C13F07
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
0xF6FC7D72
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
0x4016E47F
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
0x0C612568
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
0xB187D4DD
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
0x93D03331

0xDB06C2B2
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
0x7974459F
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
0xA0044295
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
0x12AD4FD3
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
0x8C7F6B93

0xDB06C2B2
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
0xBC12D359
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
0x408F564C
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
0x0DD672B0
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
0xB9CAAD98
inhabitants."
0x7F8A7F82

0xDB06C2B2
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
0x2FF31BCE
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
0x469761E3
and prospects?"
0x5406D346

0xDB06C2B2
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
0x72EAED52
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
0x5791D887
of her election."
0x84E9AD55

0xDB06C2B2
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
0xB6AD9F01
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
0xDF6DC6AD
becoming too irksome."
0xC3CDCFD9

0xDB06C2B2
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
0x8BD543A9
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
0x30482B6E
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
0x8F5E2492
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
0x65748344
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
0xD4DA1E67

0xDB06C2B2
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
0x3C5AD409
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
0x3C7C5702

0xDB06C2B2
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
0x137720F3
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
0x7D5B2C5D
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
0x1B1CC553
falsehood and deceit.'"
0x400B6C2C

0xDB06C2B2
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
0xEA1FB304
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
0xD3B652D7

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
0x514964B8
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
0x568C92F0
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
0x1807B2C1
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
0x367199DE
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
0x4B61BCE3
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
0x56283C60
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
0xB18ABCBD
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
0x78D058E9
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
0x5F5A19C3
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
0x721C3DF2
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
0x18AB6CE4
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
0x2B11C680
handsome attire.
0xE496710B

0xDB06C2B2
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
0x338022CC
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
0x5702A069
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
0x62A9C22E
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
0x53F743DC
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
0xA3FA8AB8
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
0xCA134F7C
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
0x25173757
fomented now within me.
0x02AAB7D2

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
0x8032B2DC
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
0x225C0087

0xDB06C2B2
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
0xCDAAD752
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
0x5CE7F59E
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
0x1C6D6BB6
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
0xC9798053
to her.
0xC315DE55

0xDB06C2B2
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
0xC1C77963
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
0xDA5D2702
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
0x765E2257

0xDB06C2B2
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
0x3AE18829
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
0x611CFB01
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
0x50BC41D7
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
0x77086998

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
0xD679C92B
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
0xE38215BE

0xDB06C2B2
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
0xF7332BD3
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
0x64AD6A2D
used to a child.
0xBD0B608B

0xDB06C2B2
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
0xA02A21E8
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
0x87E3CA30

0xDB06C2B2
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
0x2365B81E
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
0x579155B5
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
0x64EFA299
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
0x2D66DAFD
miserable cruelty."
0x6DE80BFB

0xDB06C2B2
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
0xA95E7BCE

0xDB06C2B2
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
0xD09097DB
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
0x5F5C4E52
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
0x30D70277
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
0xE0C33F55
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
0x761B6603
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
0x04009F4A
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
0x583F9546
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
0xDB53FD2C
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
0x41DB90B0
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
0x97F256ED

0xDB06C2B2
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
0x44D5662D

0xDB06C2B2
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
0xCA7D867B
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
0xE0F76F53
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
0x54836762
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
0xBB314472
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
0x2BAEA8C4
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
0xEF5A14DB
would cry.
0x8F623172

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
0x5A1D7390
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
0xCA12C767

0xDB06C2B2
"No, Mrs. Reed."
0x29016885

0xDB06C2B2
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
0x10663528
your friend."
0xF179CDD6

0xDB06C2B2
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
0x9C4E8E2A
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
0x0C1ECA21
you have done."
0x25626364

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
0x66AC194E
their faults."
0xFE81862E

0xDB06C2B2
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
0x889DCFF5

0xDB06C2B2
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
0x0F40309E
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
0x48D2D82A

0xDB06C2B2
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
0xD023FEF9
Reed, for I hate to live here."
0x5D94B41A

0xDB06C2B2
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
0x6EAF4777
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
0x2E4EC35E

0xDB06C2B2
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
0x45FAF31D
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
0xA17020FD
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
0x1DEA9190
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
0x201D5F2A
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
0x63DB1C16
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
0xEFB32818
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
0x65E1EBF3
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
0xB70DE7DB
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
0x0C0D3EDD
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
0x6FA308E5
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
0x6A121440
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
0x52F16961
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
0xEA0B28BF
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
0x0031A5CA

0xDB06C2B2
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
0x4BF050DE
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
0xE7E6EC15
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
0x51C3999F
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
0x36E3ED37
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
0x27CD522A
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
0x6BC8ECA0
of my nature.
0xA99E62A7

0xDB06C2B2
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
0xBC88A716
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
0x19C55B3A
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
0x07B3D6EC
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
0x9AB9966E
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
0x62508CD5
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
0x21621C94
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
0x3BE4FD0C
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
0x009AEC52
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
0x9283EFF3
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
0xB3E3BF18
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
0xCBCAFC31
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
0xEB1AE4CD
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
0x8E64A493
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
0xAF2ECEF9
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
0x418EA0E6
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
0x01DFF67B
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
0x09AEBFE4
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
0x6AEF9C5A

0xDB06C2B2
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
0x4E68EC8E
to lunch!"
0x291141EA

0xDB06C2B2
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
0xD403755F
came tripping down the path.
0xDF258A7D

0xDB06C2B2
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
0x763999C5
called?"
0x474F7C73

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
0x4A7A18F4
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
0x94097540
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
0x82F19AFD
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
0x97DB76E6
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
0x28AD5567
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
0x93ABC868

0xDB06C2B2
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
0xA5023C58
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
0xEF157714

0xDB06C2B2
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
0xFCAC1420
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
0x48D5A723
suppose?"
0x3F883D13

0xDB06C2B2
I nodded.
0xFEFC5FF2

0xDB06C2B2
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
0x5AD0C2C5

0xDB06C2B2
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
0xA4540449

0xDB06C2B2
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
0x1E38E962
be bolder."
0x47CCD3C0

0xDB06C2B2
"What! to get more knocks?"
0x5BCAD3AA

0xDB06C2B2
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
0x4F27A76B
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
0x1C9A5203
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
0xF44EE35F
for you."
0xF93A131A

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
0xD4913C86

"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
0xA267B10F
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
0x252E4D76
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
0xA2FD14D4
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
0xF38DD2FC
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
0xABD83110
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
0x7697F617

0xDB06C2B2
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
0x49A0DAAD

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
0x9C9661D0
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
0x3F8A4BE7
provoking."
0x1F95299E

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
0xF1357268
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
0xFBB155A9
dread."
0x846BF69B

0xDB06C2B2
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
0x24BB78AE

0xDB06C2B2
"As you do, Bessie?"
0xD60784D4

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
0xB84BDAE4
others."
0x7A6C7759

0xDB06C2B2
"You don't show it."
0x5E231C0D

0xDB06C2B2
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
0x90C86068
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
0x1175913C

0xDB06C2B2
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
0x8484DD72
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
0x174E5A00
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
0x7CD3FA0F

0xDB06C2B2
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
0xB5EEF26E

0xDB06C2B2
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
0x057C3E1E

0xDB06C2B2
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
0xF2557EAA
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
0xBE363029
you'd _rather_ not."
0x9D66F563

0xDB06C2B2
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
0x17C5A387
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
0xA1A140BF
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
0x7645A1B7
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
0x472F16CB
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.

CHAPTER V
0xD6D3CF7D

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
0x42A57B65
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
0x1C5441A6
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
0x3062A570
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
0xAB0E1E05
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
0xE545B692
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
0x4CB32E4A
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
0x9F65F53D
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
0x4D597D5D
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
0x6E32ADF3
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
0x5A17A125
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
0xA6EEADA0
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
0x2B832F5A
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
0xA9A280C4
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
0x609DF567
bye?"
0xAA64DF40

0xDB06C2B2
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
0x031D84FC
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
0x7936A98F
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
0x6979BF0E
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
0x2BBD296C

0xDB06C2B2
"What did you say, Miss?"
0x2C230127

0xDB06C2B2
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
0x12CBAD68
the wall."
0xF751B88D

0xDB06C2B2
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
0x16490D71

0xDB06C2B2
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
0x0FB9B187
been my foe."
0x079DD8EB

0xDB06C2B2
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
0xABA076C2

0xDB06C2B2
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
0xD8442690
out at the front door.
0xBC596396

0xDB06C2B2
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
0x8D2CEDFA
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
0xB9C0E5BB
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
0xBFDC0DDA
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
0x51F7CCCE
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
0x7F425480
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
0x874F04A1
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
0x35AF520F
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
0x94AA9A19
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
0xEF508DD4

0xDB06C2B2
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
0xE0071B07

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"And how far is it?"
0x1C7F8A47

0xDB06C2B2
"Fifty miles."
0xB0716B71

0xDB06C2B2
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
0x5227C265
alone."
0x62CB6044

0xDB06C2B2
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
0xB26EB00B
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
0x0CD0A203
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
0xBC918241
with kisses.
0xA6ADB617

0xDB06C2B2
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
0xA4F1A43F
me into the inside.
0xFB5486C3

0xDB06C2B2
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
0x1579BF17
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
0x428BB18F
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
0x5A55AFC0
mysterious regions.
0x300C725D

0xDB06C2B2
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
0x6E538D26
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
0xEDB1B985
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
0x41C39ECE
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
0xD966B560
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
0x5378B8D6
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
0x955A5AA6
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
0xB3CAB90E
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
0xC5E92FCD
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
0x71B05680
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
0x15BA2EFA
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
0x9B1300CD
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
0x700B1276
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
0x0A00E58C
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
0xB85F05F8
"stony street" of L-.
0x74E993B3

0xDB06C2B2
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
0x97AC7894
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
0x132BC4F2
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
0x57FECC1A
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
0xDA28A021
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
0x5261786D
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
0x0BB12A30

0xDB06C2B2
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
0x881099E5
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
0xA9B70BD7
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
0x1A8553B7
by the light of the lamps.
0xA09A750A

0xDB06C2B2
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
0x4539F2B6
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
0x0AB8E62E
instantly drove away.
0x798ED821

0xDB06C2B2
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
0x89AC0913
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
0xD8C102FE
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
0x53359C5E
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
0x75F3ABC1
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
0xDEE14527
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
0xA71B9ADC
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
0xAABC50DB
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
0x1C8B704D
with a fire, where she left me alone.
0x62645162

0xDB06C2B2
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
0x6301BDE8
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
0xA811D9A3
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
0x0EC6A3DD
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
0x626F6067
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
0x4E0981B8
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
0x66353A2C
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
0x01545AC7

0xDB06C2B2
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
0x0721B6F7
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
0xF9E1C677
grave, her bearing erect.
0xCCB93757

0xDB06C2B2
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
0xD6ECDC3B
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
0x4A712E3F
then further added--
0x62294946

0xDB06C2B2
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
0xCEF095D6
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
0x71168475

0xDB06C2B2
"A little, ma'am."
0x22E20E73

0xDB06C2B2
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
0x870956D7
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
0xC74DBDD3
come to school, my little girl?"
0xE6FD248A

0xDB06C2B2
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
0x26360903
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
0xFE1AF03C
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
0x14818406
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
0x72916617
me along with Miss Miller.
0xA9545C3D

0xDB06C2B2
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
0x8F1D0E3A
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
0x962F50E2
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
0x190D365B
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
0x60F303BF
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
0xD4F81CF7
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
0xF656B18D
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
0x64D3905C
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
0xFBD48EF4
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
0x13BE7D80
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
0x54EE52E6
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
0x21736915
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
0xD735910F
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
0x212B0852
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
0x951579CB
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
0x6F1FBCD3
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
0x8D0A6300
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
0x27A7442B
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
0x0A3CBBF8

0xDB06C2B2
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
0xB9A3843D
to the top of the long room she cried out--
0x5BF74465

0xDB06C2B2
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
0xAB06A954

0xDB06C2B2
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
0xDC3DAF74
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
0xBF00D158

0xDB06C2B2
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
0x3DD47D57

0xDB06C2B2
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
0xD7A063CE
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
0x21E983EA
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
0x7479AF6F
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
0x8F07C4B9
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
0x551E4E22
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
0xCF5013F0
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
0x5603B867

0xDB06C2B2
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
0x26E4E7F5
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
0x5F2798F8
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
0x9E0D4D05
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
0x91CE70A8
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
0x994438B0
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
0xBD480891
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
0x26961C5D
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
0x407FE69F

0xDB06C2B2
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
0x0534281C
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
0x906DF94E
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
0x1C50C2BC
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
0xBFEE6221
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
0x66B44B9B
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
0x11E4B544
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
0x4B8D77B0
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
0x0065F4F6
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
0xC227CD6C
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
0x130A5484
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
0x353BEDBD
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
0x551E4480

0xDB06C2B2
"Form classes!"
0x119358E5

0xDB06C2B2
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
0x48F4B1F1
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
0xBC7C27DF
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
0x66FBEE89
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
0xA8B7BD7C
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
0x99ABBFFE
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
0xB45427D3
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
0x646CC02D

0xDB06C2B2
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
0xE6B750FB
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
0x0C39C60D
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
0x9A78F7AF
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
0xB36F72B0
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
0x338F7BA7

0xDB06C2B2
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
0x05C0B7BF
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
0x9F80A85A
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
0x831044CF
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
0x02D715F2
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
0x1E98446E
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
0x98F8E5D9
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
0xFF4EE4E1
little the day before.
0xA06DF1C4

0xDB06C2B2
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
0xDC428EBE
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
0xC540E912
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
0x62767801
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
0x5DB024C9
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
0x0402FB0B
the first class, rose the whispered words--
0x546528C2

0xDB06C2B2
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
0xE2558B34

0xDB06C2B2
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
0x671BA625
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
0x85D8D087
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
0xFFCCD7B4
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
0x5011152B
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
0xF3E91428
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
0xDCEA2154
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
0xAC8AE6D6
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
0xF3B9EC17
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
0x08F5B687
the meal began.
0xFDA38BAC

0xDB06C2B2
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
0x9C9E096A
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
0xC3A66280
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
0x380A0A9C
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
0x5837D772
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
0xC257D70B
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
0x523404AD
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
0x28015A7F
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
0xBDB81179
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
0x642B1D84
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
0x41E5EF89
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
0xE9592088
them, the stout one, whispered--
0xA39472F0

0xDB06C2B2
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
0xEB1F872E

0xDB06C2B2
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
0x854E7570
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
0x5242DCEA
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
0x04240775
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
0x5C606DC2
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
0x5D4A2C59
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
0x5EED7D14
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
0xE8044108
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
0xEEA5FE3A
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
0x2ABB5C2A
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
0x952F8208

0xDB06C2B2
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
0x8A3C6127
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
0x01A1B579

0xDB06C2B2
"Silence!  To your seats!"
0xCFB31712

0xDB06C2B2
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
0xE72BAC13
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
0x4C1E3E6E
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
0xABD74F1D
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
0x67991BDF
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
0xE6A6B94C
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
0x3808EA06
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
0xF3A62EF2
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
0x561A2438
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
0xF914FF43
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
0x87B270B2
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
0xC0E18C37
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
0x5BA490A4
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
0x2278B12D

0xDB06C2B2
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
0xEC505F8C
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
0x7F876C5D
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
0x392EDBD8
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
0x95E7DC65
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
0x81C132BA
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
0xEB8BB317

0xDB06C2B2
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
0x6975515E
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
0xA36AC78D
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
0x1B82C983
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
0xAE5D0028
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
0xE2A8CC25
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
0x23FA31BE
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
0x00D32890
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
0xF898C372

0xDB06C2B2
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
0xA6D090C4

0xDB06C2B2
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
0x1124A4FD
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
0xD3B1626E
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
0xB4221C46
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
0xEDBBAE42
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
0x7784880E
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
0x78411E47
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
0x69E07EFC
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
0xB6D36320
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
0xEF37FA67
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
0xE42C972A
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
0x8CD0ABE9
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
0xBCFC47F1
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
0xD6BD411F
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
0xCA76A659
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
0x608C205B
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
0xBB77197A

0xDB06C2B2
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
0x5811307F
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
0x03F2855F
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
0x2D531E23
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
0xE3ACD6E8
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
0x467707E7
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
0xB58F65C7
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
0xDBC34209
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
0x27440B13

0xDB06C2B2
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
0xF36D5B33

0xDB06C2B2
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
0x0D64685F
sank at her voice.  She went on--
0x644B50A6

0xDB06C2B2
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
0x3BD30B12
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
0x71533290
to all."
0xE8F482A7

0xDB06C2B2
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
0x61469B5D

0xDB06C2B2
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
0xC62152AE
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
0xF00F552B

0xDB06C2B2
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
0x36526F95
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
0xC556C75A
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
0x4E2988B9
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
0x427B835E
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
0xAA2A571D

0xDB06C2B2
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
0x6D3CFE16
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
0x0EABE952
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
0x341EE7E4
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
0x2D710407
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
0x83004A8D
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
0x1834B014
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
0x23BF8AB3
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
0xFC136104
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
0xEE25CECC
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
0xE5BADB59
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
0xAAA9BB41
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
0xD6B92A9F
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
0xC908D3F5
hollow cough.
0x408F820A

0xDB06C2B2
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
0xC9827CE2
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
0xE321C238
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
0x9ABFA30B
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
0x1447850C
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
0x950319AB
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
0x894481F8
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
0x2BFADF54
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
0x882A09E8
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
0x01A1A2B0
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
0xEEF55322
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
0xD617073D
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
0x1497522A
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
0xFAB4782A
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
0x07688984
this inscription:--
0x08C7D26D

0xDB06C2B2
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
0x3BD1B3D9
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
0x945FB6C7
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
0x54743C18
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
0x872101C6

0xDB06C2B2
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
0x5026450F
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
0x3F4755C8
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
0x530E2C75
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
0x6ED0EBAD
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
0xCFC1FF3F
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
0x19C787A7
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
0x3D60EC89
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
0x3E218489
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
0x64B8F609
I said to her directly--
0xC6CAD4F7

0xDB06C2B2
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
0x2321A9C0
her to lend it to me some day.
0xA15D53C8

0xDB06C2B2
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
0x1FD41532
she examined me.
0xA4CC9DCE

0xDB06C2B2
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
0x9E4ED548
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
0x0B62B4C8
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
0x9F314AA5
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
0x61A1D6CF
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
0x0E01F4B6
or substantial.
0x3E56605B

0xDB06C2B2
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
0x344A3A68

0xDB06C2B2
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
0x95CE651A
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
0x7360E62F
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
0x1F6EF3B2
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
0x2ECB978F
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
0xF6706653
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
0xAC2353C9

0xDB06C2B2
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What
0xFEB24819
is Lowood Institution?"
0x901A02AF

0xDB06C2B2
"This house where you are come to live."
0x9348C7FE

0xDB06C2B2
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from
0x2DF65F6A
other schools?"
0xCAD942E0

0xDB06C2B2
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
0xC71B1002
charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
0x5D841358
father or your mother dead?"
0xE4FA7C96

0xDB06C2B2
"Both died before I can remember."
0x29AAA150

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this
0x6251FD71
is called an institution for educating orphans."
0x6364C354

0xDB06C2B2
"Do we pay no money?  Do they keep us for nothing?"
0x4D2F37B7

0xDB06C2B2
"We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each."
0x02BBAA77

0xDB06C2B2
"Then why do they call us charity-children?"
0xEC588C16

0xDB06C2B2
"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the
0x2E011EF7
deficiency is supplied by subscription."
0x4668BDDD

0xDB06C2B2
"Who subscribes?"
0xDBA2CCA3

0xDB06C2B2
"Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood
0xF623F6AD
and in London."
0x4C53EC3B

0xDB06C2B2
"Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?"
0xBDA91991

0xDB06C2B2
"The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,
0x02238727
and whose son overlooks and directs everything here."
0xF8795425

0xDB06C2B2
"Why?"
0x899CA234

0xDB06C2B2
"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."
0x5A95ABC9

0xDB06C2B2
"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and
0x1DB8CBBB
who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"
0x7C4B6377

0xDB06C2B2
"To Miss Temple?  Oh, no!  I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.
0x660C2274
Brocklehurst for all she does.  Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and
0x6A8A3C45
all our clothes."
0xD9BC7EEA

0xDB06C2B2
"Does he live here?"
0x2695A45C

0xDB06C2B2
"No--two miles off, at a large hall."
0x4A71E8FF

0xDB06C2B2
"Is he a good man?"
0xA1C740B0

0xDB06C2B2
"He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good."
0x57F03195

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?"
0x37CA6284

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"And what are the other teachers called?"
0xB332FEA7

0xDB06C2B2
"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,
0xE1207D27
and cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
0x4076C62D
everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches
0x8CCB10F9
history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one
0x7859EF18
who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a
0xE0C52552
yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and
0xA65D5DD2
teaches French."
0x88B741CE

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you like the teachers?"
0x67C3247D

0xDB06C2B2
"Well enough."
0x72FA95BF

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?--I cannot
0xF89995B9
pronounce her name as you do."
0x7EE70D5D

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her; Madame
0x566993C6
Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."
0xAD6A5E44

0xDB06C2B2
"But Miss Temple is the best--isn't she?"
0x99524E61

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because
0x5189E563
she knows far more than they do."
0x33C32FC8

0xDB06C2B2
"Have you been long here?"
0x4EDC5EAE

0xDB06C2B2
"Two years."
0xDEC523C5

0xDB06C2B2
"Are you an orphan?"
0xB09C6273

0xDB06C2B2
"My mother is dead."
0x9F21E059

0xDB06C2B2
"Are you happy here?"
0x879244E1

0xDB06C2B2
"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for
0x111F4811
the present: now I want to read."
0x21C27D9E

0xDB06C2B2
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
0xB6B75C59
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
0xD17527A9
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
0xCC025C79
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
0xA938A07F
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
0x2DAF2B13
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
0x092FA2FD
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
0xAFC5B2C8
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
0xDF4940FE
day's fare would be like this.
0x4832F4A2

0xDB06C2B2
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
0x86CC42A6
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
0xE8806472

0xDB06C2B2
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
0x850DC967
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
0x2C252559
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
0x4BC6AA98
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
0x2F6DC7FA
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
0x3D1DBA85
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
0x122A131D
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
0x853651FF
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
0xF2E8F1D1
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
0xB0D82406
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
0xF4DD0DE2
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
0xAEFA5D5E
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
0x27805D9B
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
0xA0681190
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
0xC71A10D0
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
0xF2E734C9
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
0x919A350A

0xDB06C2B2
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
0x92674E00
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
0xC9927BFB
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
0x1350770B
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
0xBDAA5CA7
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
0x9A44FF0A
first day at Lowood.
0x97A876E4

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
CHAPTER VI
0xD75EC5BB

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
0x8B21CC13
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
0x68F1FFE2
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
0xCD7A1301
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
0x97ECA299
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
0x77F4F7D9
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
0x8D74B90F

0xDB06C2B2
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
0xB93FA7C1
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
0x8E4201AF
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
0xA36AF4E6
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
0x25C854B0

0xDB06C2B2
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
0x4268B0BF
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
0xD4DAD5EE
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
0xADB9338D
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
0x08EA4DE1
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
0x4D1270E4
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
0xEBEA9FEA
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
0x738D16B5
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
0x6500783E
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
0xF57316CA
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
0x97B9142D
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
0xE2266D2B
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
0xB4502C7F
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
0x6DD7B672
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
0xC29D5F4B
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
0x6081A5C4
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
0x3E0D95DC
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
0x4DBD9B23
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
0x6F9EAF2B
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
0x455BBA07
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
0x3E7D8C1C

0xDB06C2B2
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
0x13B1C963
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
0xF8938D9F
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
0x3428E29B
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
0xE630191E
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
0x8D925D2E
&c. &c.
0xB46BC20D

0xDB06C2B2
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
0x34A7E5AA
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
0x9031CBF5
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
0x6F33F10E
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
0x3A785A17
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
0x03BA2C6E
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
0x1527BECA
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
0xA6944558
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
0xF789496A

0xDB06C2B2
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
0x751691AF
morning!"
0xDC120EC2

0xDB06C2B2
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
0x56135329
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
0xCDB71D9B
as the water was frozen?"
0xA586E7DE

0xDB06C2B2
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
0xCD449A6B
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
0x6BC2FB75
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
0xC5B30A82
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
0x94CA67CE
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
0x0EA30D6E
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
0xF7FB0149
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
0xD2D993D8
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
0x4958CA86
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
0xFD36441C
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
0xC0A9475B
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
0xFCC775B4
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
0xDCA9A6A4
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
0x5D42CC82
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
0xED045304
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
0x4C140E1A
altered its ordinary expression.
0xEAAE79AC

0xDB06C2B2
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
0x23680236
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
0x9C821D3A

0xDB06C2B2
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
0xB3715C11
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
0x039041AC
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
0xBAEE890E

0xDB06C2B2
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
0xCEAE9F7A
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
0xBDB317C2
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
0xE4153BEF
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
0x9D006B3F
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
0xFB8CB87E
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
0x70B0B4FC
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
0x784BE3C9
one a welcome sense of liberty.
0xB7FC53F1

0xDB06C2B2
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
0xC51CD7D7
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
0x9C8DC1E8
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
0x69B8496A
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
0xAE95E264
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
0xE3ECCD91
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
0x644BF72F
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
0xD338F43F

0xDB06C2B2
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
0x2F1C069F
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
0x1E566B7A
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
0x4BB9385F
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
0x41564830
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
0xF860D9AC
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
0x7ABC685C
to clamour.
0x0F04719F

0xDB06C2B2
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
0x46AECE81
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
0x40DB25B4
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
0x9AAF7C2B
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
0x415E0C98

0xDB06C2B2
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
0x4184EF9D

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
0x5C8BC4AD

0xDB06C2B2
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
0x48C4DC0E
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
0x3AEE225F
floor.
0x213CCB18

0xDB06C2B2
"What is your name besides Burns?"
0x22B9A6EA

0xDB06C2B2
"Helen."
0xA36BE275

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you come a long way from here?"
0x79A6BCEB

0xDB06C2B2
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
0xF45213EC

0xDB06C2B2
"Will you ever go back?"
0x75148C4C

0xDB06C2B2
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
0x51E16EA2

0xDB06C2B2
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
0xEDA2CB03

0xDB06C2B2
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
0x094C04D0
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
0x38DFB5E5

0xDB06C2B2
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
0x303559C1

0xDB06C2B2
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
0x3296D047

0xDB06C2B2
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
0x9666DB44
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
0x0BDAB415
break it under her nose."
0xA02EFC7C

0xDB06C2B2
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
0x184588DA
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
0xD92CBA6B
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
0xFEF1E3D2
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
0xD53A749D
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
0x8FD0B217
Bible bids us return good for evil."
0xF51CED6C

0xDB06C2B2
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
0xF8AAF26C
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
0x3171BFDA
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
0xF69B3F9C

0xDB06C2B2
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
0xC2EA0B27
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
0xC91809AA
required to bear."
0x0663496C

0xDB06C2B2
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
0x89721047
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
0x5CB2A36C
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
0x9B2A09D9
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
0x6B8C0BD7
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
0x48C7DF8D
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
0x51727402

0xDB06C2B2
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
0xBEAEB835
good."
0xCD74269E

0xDB06C2B2
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
0x9214D021
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
0xEA201F66
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
0xC27305FB
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
0x6A906449
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
0x7D249B88
Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."
0xCF5B1B8A

0xDB06C2B2
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
0xA50B15DF
addition: she kept silence.
0x6C333039

0xDB06C2B2
"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
0x160E5394

0xDB06C2B2
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
0x960783BE
grave face.
0xF968CFE6

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
0x2C080DFA
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
0x6A0011D3
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
0x039B9F21
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
0x77F62AF4
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
0xD5437984
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
0xA01FDD8E
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."
0xC924FB9C

0xDB06C2B2
"That is curious," said I, "it is so easy to be careful."
0x0311A3EC

0xDB06C2B2
"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
0x5ED4D1F6
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
0x334C092D
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
0x4D9F5FC9
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
0xA159A9DD
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
0x1038E065
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
0xE209A979
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
0xEDB61A97
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
0x1979B8E9
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
0x5FCA38B0
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
0xBCBA2AF4
answer ready."
0x98E93011

0xDB06C2B2
"Yet how well you replied this afternoon."
0x05AE0F60

0xDB06C2B2
"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
0x9E9D1DA0
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
0xB43057FC
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
0xE3929BF9
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
0x9363FF13
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
0x497DDB5B
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
0x025F456E
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
0xBF0E20FD
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
0xF025C70A
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
0xF8AA86AE
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"
0xD1A65A08

0xDB06C2B2
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
0x396E24C0
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
0x653C0B96
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.
0x1078BFD1

0xDB06C2B2
"And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"
0x79D4C0B9

0xDB06C2B2
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
0xFDA713D0
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
0x160F5774
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
0x0FAF87D3
I wished to gain."
0x0228714E

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"
0x0104D110

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides
0xA01DEA00
me.  There is no merit in such goodness."
0xB4134A5E

0xDB06C2B2
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
0x84439CFB
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
0x2BF23373
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
0x17DFDBE9
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
0x3D856887
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
0x2AD6332E
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
0x3A03F16D
person who struck us never to do it again."
0x2FF8CA4D

0xDB06C2B2
"You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are
0xB4636B45
but a little untaught girl."
0x02ED713C

0xDB06C2B2
"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to
0x06B23416
please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
0xF4D610B3
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
0x70752AB8
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."
0xF82CF217

0xDB06C2B2
"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and
0x7C782683
civilised nations disown it."
0xBB998BCA

0xDB06C2B2
"How?  I don't understand."
0xB5B4B055

0xDB06C2B2
"It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most
0xB503F130
certainly heals injury."
0x0E49F505

0xDB06C2B2
"What then?"
0x1FEF7492

0xDB06C2B2
"Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;
0x68D30D9F
make His word your rule, and His conduct your example."
0xC2D0592F

0xDB06C2B2
"What does He say?"
0x48E05708

0xDB06C2B2
"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate
0xBED0A616
you and despitefully use you."
0x95E3567B

0xDB06C2B2
"Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son
0xF6552AE6
John, which is impossible."
0x7B22A3FD

0xDB06C2B2
In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
0x86B3A494
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
0x18863D59
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or
0x7961E894
softening.
0xE882F557

0xDB06C2B2
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
0x49026D44
remark, but she said nothing.
0xDD26E65E

0xDB06C2B2
"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
0x77272AC8
woman?"
0xC912F4F5

0xDB06C2B2
"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your
0x8B281D55
cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
0x17F271CF
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
0x7F42CF7F
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
0x89A6CA66
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
0xD657FD11
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
0x8AB9C280
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
0x932FE91B
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
0x1A95A496
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
0xDBE1A457
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
0xF7859741
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
0x78F61B19
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
0x02B5ACBD
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
0xF2AF3B0D
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
0x21F23F95
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
0x7E538189
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
0x3FF26027
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
0xA030BC9A
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
0x5EF2BECF
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
0x77E4519B
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
0x0F37D39E
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
0xDD347ABA
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
0x1069E494
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
0xC747809C
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
0xD3722E13
never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."
0xD1B13FC1

0xDB06C2B2
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
0x4E24E2AF
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
0xEC2EC64A
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
0x7FAFD71C
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
0x6D07E4B6
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
0x16BFCBE1

0xDB06C2B2
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
0xDA860437
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"
0x1C5378A1

0xDB06C2B2
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
0xDF7E0A0F
without reply as without delay.
0x6BF53B43

CHAPTER VII
0x85FD134E

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
0x865F7BF9
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
0xB0AC4FF9
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
0x6D5691C6
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
0xFF3B2CEF
were no trifles.
0x23652086

0xDB06C2B2
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
0xCE1F450F
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
0xD86D314F
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
0xE755F4C7
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
0x59581268
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
0x3F0EB2ED
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
0xD67A0D1B
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
0x979454D9
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
0x8B1A963D
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
0x5731DE34
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
0x02937B9C
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
0x33DE2E21
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
0x2E4C1764
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
0x53C5DB19
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
0x203793ED
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
0xAAF075EA
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
0x210C484B
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
0xA61A6471
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
0x4ABE7158
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
0x538E3470

0xDB06C2B2
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
0x2F4FBC9C
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
0xB30F462C
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
0x2EE8FBCD
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
0x8D5406F2
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
0x89240826
meals, was served round between the services.
0x6A0F0812

0xDB06C2B2
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
0xA61A0EFA
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
0xDC62099E
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
0x04DE9D9A

0xDB06C2B2
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
0xB2FE5839
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
0x7A32BA39
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
0x53DB562B
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
0x951F7E02
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
0xCE9779F1
to attempt the task of cheering others.
0xA4A24407

0xDB06C2B2
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
0xBD8D9DF2
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
0xA677665C
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
0xF8FBB2B3
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
0xEC47AE33
starved arms in their pinafores.
0x373C2CBC

0xDB06C2B2
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
0xDA38BC37
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
0xF30C83C9
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
0x037E9653
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
0xE823309B
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
0x1500C7EF

The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
0x2AC8FA56
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
0x41D0DDD8
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
0x9F2BDE8A
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
0x9381DD90
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
0x158A8974
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
0xBD20FFFC
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
0x4E32EDC3
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
0x7B86DD63
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
0xD7F2FA31
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
0x4AEC7B92
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
0xDD9CD848

0xDB06C2B2
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
0xA61D7316
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
0xA71BE405
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
0x1742F47F
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
0x4556F3A8
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
0xA7DE6590

0xDB06C2B2
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
0xB3DE6BB3
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
0xB34A54F4
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
0x1E3A42FF
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
0xC2C582B2
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
0xBA0A90E6
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
0x551C4927
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
0x044CCB89
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
0x7398FD04
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
0xF0D45CD7
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
0x1CB73580
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
0x5832DC4C
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
0xE637092E

0xDB06C2B2
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
0xBE891A3C
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
0x589A1CA0
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
0xF9EE3DC6
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
0xF819984B
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
0x321B2E04
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
0x99A0735F
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
0xE711510F

0xDB06C2B2
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
0x750BFE52
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
0xAD188362
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
0x98CCFCDB
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
0xAE8F6BE8
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
0x23DA4A81
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
0x44AAD53B

0xDB06C2B2
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
0x02746ACB
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
0x3175DA05
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
0xA69E352D
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
0xCE87672B
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
0xBA02E434
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
0x93927B3B
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
0x0F065CCE
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
0xFCD237A3
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
0x4390F114
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
0x7E53AF86
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
0x3E33EE68

0xDB06C2B2
He paused.
0x02607736

0xDB06C2B2
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
0x6A5A76DE

0xDB06C2B2
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
0xF22F7642
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
0x7107F36D
to one."
0x37A04457

0xDB06C2B2
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
0x207900A4
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
0xD398843D
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
0x3420212B
occasion."
0x20226CE5

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
0x0DD9C2B6

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
0xC5DD1FFB
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
0x3ED7C89D
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
0x2682B7AA
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
0x162F3D97
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
0x450EE7BC
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
0x407398AE
what authority?"
0x51BA7B07

0xDB06C2B2
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
0xBA728B9D
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
0xDC5DD291
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
0xCD46488A

0xDB06C2B2
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
0x05DC2D28
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
0x32ECE7A2
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
0xC5AE96D0
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
0x2FDB2BB9
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
0x954E2D4C
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
0xDB9D2201
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
0x9B1D963F
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
0xF81EB35D
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
0xC41F41D8
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
0x9E00EEAC
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
0x8FADA771
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
0xDAE47A0F
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
0x9952BE4D
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
0xBC453CED
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
0xBF557671
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
0x4D8B9E27
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
0x511CC9CA
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
0x98978CBC
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
0x8CBEC7E9

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
0xEE8F8734
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
0x21582ED2
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
0x8B38C7E8
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
0x841D9910
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
0x40EDF39A
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
0x8194C9F0
severity.
0xCB6AA4F6

0xDB06C2B2
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
0xEC2789D9
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
0x2313E0C6
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
0x1B3CAD6D
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
0x3033A798

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
0x1888FCA3
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
0xE79560C9
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
0x737F0ACE

0xDB06C2B2
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
0x454B862E

0xDB06C2B2
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
0x6DE64E30
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
0xE067DF73
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
0xDC77D062
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
0xDECA611C

0xDB06C2B2
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
0x30DBA251

0xDB06C2B2
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
0x5BA904E8
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
0xD54BF67F
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
0xC8E23BD3
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
0xB03F6647
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
0xF068D279
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
0xD696045F
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
0xBE72A5EA

0xDB06C2B2
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
0x218698F8
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
0x547882EF
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
0x6BEE6F2B
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
0xDD34463B
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
0xA28ABB4F
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
0xD7CBBCC4
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
0x300B2356
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
0x1B4EF63F

0xDB06C2B2
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
0xF6B84BE4
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
0x296478D7

0xDB06C2B2
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
0x04D1FB43

0xDB06C2B2
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
0xF77CF153

0xDB06C2B2
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
0xA14201C3
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
0x62A6A3B5
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
0x594B0AEC
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
0xFD585327
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
0x1507B328
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
0xD9DB1158
time wasted, of--"
0x49722C92

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
0x8C6A7CEF
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
0xBA1D23C9
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
0x63B2452E
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
0x22F0117D
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
0x4998F760
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
0x2097964B
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
0x0B6154D3
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
0x3816E26C
false front of French curls.
0xD6F56752

0xDB06C2B2
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
0x23A83E90
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
0x06A55D6F
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
0xD9051A5A
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
0x40AE24BE
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
0x5886AE75
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
0x5B4926D8
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
0x34039D34
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
0x47E05650
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
0xEF3B4765
my attention.
0x5B274710

0xDB06C2B2
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
0x6B0F729E
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
0x193FB6BE
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
0x52C349FE
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
0x389A3B97
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
0xCD595C33
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
0x4D7AE1C2
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
0xE83AA193
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
0xB2296DAA
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
0xA82FB51E
my forces for the worst.  It came.
0xDB51FE99

0xDB06C2B2
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
0x38DDF824
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
0x02FCF889
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
0x8997A021
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
0xB9EF8E47

0xDB06C2B2
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
0xE6205273
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
0xF72EF89B
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
0x92CCCE8C
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
0xA191D43B

0xDB06C2B2
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
0xE5944C42
punished."
0x6791BED5

0xDB06C2B2
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
0x761494EB

0xDB06C2B2
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
0x34A88FA1
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
0xC14064AF
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
0x0E49C057

0xDB06C2B2
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
0x9871DB9F
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
0x1B164B20

0xDB06C2B2
"Place the child upon it."
0x6E7AD925

0xDB06C2B2
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
0x911A6949
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
0x08E74520
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
0x5F4690DD
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
0xF41B6DAD
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
0x80D6FC1A

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
0x77F73AA8

0xDB06C2B2
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
0x263418EA
children, you all see this girl?"
0xB05052AD

0xDB06C2B2
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
0xB0550B84
against my scorched skin.
0x3E1A6E93

0xDB06C2B2
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
0xC59C9755
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
0xA9333A35
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
0x45A27D92
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
0xF5432923
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
0xE86DEAC0

0xDB06C2B2
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
0xEBF0D293
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
0xB424F6A6
must be firmly sustained.
0x4B8057CC

0xDB06C2B2
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
0xED45F6E7
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
0xE2115901
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
0x585388A8
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
0x056216F7
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
0x2E995ED7
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
0x9EDF3C32
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
0xE6AE0E8B
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
0xD42FB161
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
0x57617A26
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
0x85745543
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
0x7E357061
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
0x1F9191DD

0xDB06C2B2
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
0x0AF413A0
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
0xAF0AE199
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
0xC521B0D3
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
0x861430CD
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
0x586D0694

0xDB06C2B2
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
0x8F41B1AA
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
0xD890A615
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
0xB8879F3F
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
0xBE231643
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
0x5B21BDA1
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
0x647C8560
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
0x7BCB44B9
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
0xFC10EBFC
waters to stagnate round her."
0xF8073C85

0xDB06C2B2
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
0x1099CE1F
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
0x36B48252
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
0xFDFEE8FE
Turning at the door, my judge said--
0x6FF4A8F4

0xDB06C2B2
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
0x532A93F0
her during the remainder of the day."
0xDFE2C36D

0xDB06C2B2
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
0x0BA86C94
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
0xE76E1E1A
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
0x2014C12E
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
0xDF47D431
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
0xC25134DF
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
0x838AFBBA
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
0x7A12B563
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
0x3EB92924
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
0x315A0F93
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
0x4FCE659B
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
0x56A4209C
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
0x3919A251
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
0x232A1EF8
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
0x5AD1854E
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
0x9476224F
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
0x37D17A2C
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
0x9A686ADE
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
0xAAC859AF
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
0x7E2F18F1
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
0x2E3042C6
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
0xDD9D8A00
the full brightness of the orb.

CHAPTER VIII
0xE7ACF604

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
0x17C307F8
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
0x0741B4E8
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
0x44EE1F7D
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
0x263CA153
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
0x010E9C70
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
0x0005CDE6
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
0xA2779F17
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
0xE72C3F0E
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
0xCC7C30BA
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
0xFA72251C
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
0x9686C417
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
0x97CC0B6F
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
0x155F309F
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
0xE1537E53
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
0x21F98CE2
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
0x20719E5E

0xDB06C2B2
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
0x4F853DAE
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
0xF6DF1970
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
0x29FB4417
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
0x089AB513

0xDB06C2B2
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
0xAA0EFB4C
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
0x851DE11C
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
0x82464B3A
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
0xA5D82690
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
0xCF46DDA4
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
0xAE102340
first who spoke--
0xF57345EC

0xDB06C2B2
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
0xFC6E4CE4
liar?"
0x7422574B

0xDB06C2B2
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
0x033D60B2
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
0x57860988

0xDB06C2B2
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
0xA3E6367F

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
0xC887D56F
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
0xA60907C8

0xDB06C2B2
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
0x1166193E

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
0x6A557815
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
0x4B2EA2A2
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
0x8CC0A355
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
0x7506E266
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
0x589747B1
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
0x4AAF4349
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
0x08D7605C
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
0x938F8B5A
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
0xE7798C20

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
0xD7E5EEC3
gently to warm them, and went on--
0xBF0DAB75

0xDB06C2B2
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
0x4261A72E
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
0x35FE8CC7
without friends."
0xBEECFEE8

0xDB06C2B2
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
0x70157A1A
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
0x0D3998CE
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
0xE8AC8D5F
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
0xEB821E18
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
0x1EA033A7
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
0x7FDB4648

0xDB06C2B2
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
0x0F81918B
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
0x672E667B
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
0x930FED57
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
0xE7EC02DA
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
0xCA8897EE
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
0x7B765EF2
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
0x831D3933
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
0xE2C69BA2
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
0x7ADF8153
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
0x9D17E1DC
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
0x44677B05
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
0x7D765B94
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
0x6FE2039D
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
0x321B2026
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
0x15519417

0xDB06C2B2
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
0x36808D1B
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
0xBD954D8D
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
0xEBB808F6
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
0x83E24ADC
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
0x59FCE350

0xDB06C2B2
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
0x463CF69F
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
0x55A88172
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
0xB695C9DB
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
0xBB7B5572
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
0x8B5E6379
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
0x17B8FC92

0xDB06C2B2
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
0xC08DCB2B
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
0x6C41C74D

0xDB06C2B2
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
0xCC99A476
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
0xCA5F8A45
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
0x6970F5C7
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
0x43C097C6
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
0x7AAC0B8C

0xDB06C2B2
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
0x0D4516A8
your grief away?"
0x6EE2052A

0xDB06C2B2
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
0xE9A8BB79

0xDB06C2B2
"Why?"
0x899CA234

0xDB06C2B2
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
0xAA372203
will now think me wicked."
0xAA0AD5AD

0xDB06C2B2
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
0x64647440
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
0xE3E125E0

0xDB06C2B2
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
0x002F83E3

0xDB06C2B2
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
0xDDDFD87A
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
0xDDE3B35C

0xDB06C2B2
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
0xC3D1EFF9
care."
0x2F2C9A53

0xDB06C2B2
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
0x68A91A91

0xDB06C2B2
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
0xBE28C63E
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
0xA3B48595
always keep me."
0x3C64AE46

0xDB06C2B2
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
0xF69A3083
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
0xD1A20CF0
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
0xD0516864
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
0x495AA332
exaggerate nothing."
0xE14C8003

0xDB06C2B2
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
0x1AEE7309
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
0xB219D87E
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
0xF030B235
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
0x3B36BA92
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
0x5BD4A517
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
0xA4387EB6
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
0x4493943A
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
0x96076D4C
Temple fully believed me.
0xF49369A2

0xDB06C2B2
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
0x63548C96
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
0xCC3B5D99
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
0x696875C7
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
0x569A25C9
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
0xC53752DD
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
0xDC7A1BC9

0xDB06C2B2
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
0x8BAC056C
then said--
0x2B8CC022

0xDB06C2B2
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
0xBB748159
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
0x458C2FFA
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
0x3F0D0749

0xDB06C2B2
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
0x0C50E5EC
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
0x3A484EDD
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
0x9042C38E
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
0xFCF0790F
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
0x73CA6656

0xDB06C2B2
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
0xFBAD11BC

0xDB06C2B2
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
0x92A1091A

0xDB06C2B2
"And the pain in your chest?"
0x622FCF6E

0xDB06C2B2
"It is a little better."
0xF896F66A

0xDB06C2B2
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
0x9E650795
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
0xF618023F
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
0x31F3DAEA

0xDB06C2B2
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
0xE5E32DEA
rang her bell.
0x4E7C9EE3

0xDB06C2B2
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
0xD93C2975
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
0xC2E31C5B

0xDB06C2B2
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
0xCA37278F
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
0xF2DA3089
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
0x79BBDD15
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
0xD7490F35
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
0x6474E2CE

0xDB06C2B2
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
0xFC78AAF4
There is not enough for three."
0x959F903A

0xDB06C2B2
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
0xBE6FFA09

0xDB06C2B2
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
0xBFC63080

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
0x120BBB27
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
0xBA27C1FB

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
0xB61D61B3
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
0xD1226940
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
0x61358C38

0xDB06C2B2
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
0xA6FD1068
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
0x0C66B0B7
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
0x3814E572
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
0x234D29DB

0xDB06C2B2
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
0xA1DA0A53
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
0xEF018C94
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
0x5E9849E1

0xDB06C2B2
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
0x2A1738B3
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
0xD9562706
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
0x7C92600E
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
0x74C66BD6

0xDB06C2B2
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
0x383AC2C6
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
0x3368CB0E
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
0x65F3E74B

0xDB06C2B2
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
0xC0C464A7
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
0xE75D27F9
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
0x297EFFEF
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
0x5D2094A3
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
0x16DCAA69
struck with wonder.
0x8E2F189F

0xDB06C2B2
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
0x1C30CB0E
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
0x35DBD9D2
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
0xCF36E256
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
0xA1F64D64
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
0x1121DF20
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
0x4A948909
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
0x72E2F383
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
0xDCB67EDE
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
0xC2FB45AA
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
0x53D088DA
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
0xB34F4F63
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
0xED640357
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
0x0D7DC5D8
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
0x2F8F4C8C

0xDB06C2B2
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
0xA27B4D6C
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
0x0CC49043
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
0x93FD48D8
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
0x5EA99C01
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
0xCB33CAD4
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
0xB248F601
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
0xCBA663F0
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
0xBE25D2AA
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
0x23DD7969
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
0xACE55FF5
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
0x7F678846

0xDB06C2B2
"God bless you, my children!"
0xEF2C2F49

0xDB06C2B2
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
0xCAE006A9
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
0xC9393951
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
0xB43E6C1D

0xDB06C2B2
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
0x31B23B45
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
0x94402765
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
0xE3077750
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
0x0F7E663B
shoulder.
0xE448992A

0xDB06C2B2
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
0x807566D3
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
0x1FDA846A

0xDB06C2B2
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
0x16216175
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
0x09B6E261
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
0x7EA30696
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
0x87035C8B
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
0x1AD96E54
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
0xB005118C
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
0x42864D8F
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
0x51CEBC0F
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
0xC579A293

0xDB06C2B2
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
0xA38CA0C2
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
0x0D5EB3B6
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
0x63C34AB9
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
0x6DBAC098
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
0x91302184
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
0xA3F34373
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
0x5C43A0F2
through the ranks of my companions.
0x6F67FF73

0xDB06C2B2
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
0xCA89BD28
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
0x99840CE5
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
0x8E65F462
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
0x16BF6478
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
0xCFE4A3C3
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
0x2E373CDE
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
0x634E2229
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
0x46B9C936
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
0xC6580B4C
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
0x55F530F7
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
0x9504DCEE
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
0x8238810D
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
0xDD273A12
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
0xABB7C187
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
0xB87EE68A
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
0xF1552F82
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
0x39ED31B7
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
0x7A56527D
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
0xA492AC31
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
0xF48F25F8

0xDB06C2B2
Well has Solomon said--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a

stalled ox and hatred therewith."
0xDDBDDE89

0xDB06C2B2
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
0xAB019DD6
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.

CHAPTER IX
0x28A77CE6

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
0x8F36588E
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
0x7A146120
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
0x67C3942F
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
0xB5415ABD
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
0xEE6391F6
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
0x762B07D5
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
0x4DCEEF9E
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
0x46B02E4D
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
0x9020EF19
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
0x5AB7EC3C
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
0xC9B09B5A
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
0x15FF2713
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
0x8C25CB55
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
0x2F29FDCB

0xDB06C2B2
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
0xFB6B9E6A
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
0xA7209DF6
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
0x12CCD0EF
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
0x7CC2B0EF
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
0x61DE8E18
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
0x2DA7F222
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
0x369D4CF6
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
0x836EC10B
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
0x5971CEC6
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
0xE3F72883
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
0x464746E9
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
0x84C57B8E
of skeletons.
0x59129F5D

0xDB06C2B2
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
0x77E735C2
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
0x3809F3FF
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
0x631110A9
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
0x76EBF507
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
0x286044CC
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
0xFDB8D1D4
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
0xE555D61E
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
0xBC8836DA
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
0x29BE4AE6
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
0x3BCFDEAF
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
0x4C953EC2
advert.
0x9E62AF4D

0xDB06C2B2
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
0x0A59A45E
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
0x4A954153
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
0x561DF830
question.
0xB446E269

0xDB06C2B2
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
0x78899DD1
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
0xFAE6FA7F
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
0x5200064C
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
0x90F5BF27
hospital.
0xB262969B

0xDB06C2B2
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
0x677A60AF
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
0x72BFCCF2
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
0x645813A9
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
0x1F1DAC79
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
0x6717C768
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
0x28FBB8B8
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
0xE92044D3
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
0x52F7D677
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
0xEE8A8448
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
0xC2CE2C65
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
0x31949316
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
0x55468E44
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
0xA3666A3D
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
0x41DD2562

0xDB06C2B2
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
0xCFBEF0AB
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
0x59CBDC11
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
0x74EF57A2
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
0x1266846B
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
0xDEDEAE8D
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
0x8FB90320
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
0x65D236F0
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
0xF2816B63
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
0x50521E08
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
0xA3B1A436
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
0xC4C2D052
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
0xBBADC8DA

0xDB06C2B2
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
0x3EB4CE16
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
0x14900793
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
0x96B5ECD6
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
0x2D2BF345
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
0xB68B438D
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
0xF7960C81
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
0x79795B17
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
0x989D074F
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
0xF225DE4A
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
0xFEB859EB
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
0x90859085
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
0x028A9131
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
0xF7A717BE

0xDB06C2B2
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
0x2E6795C1
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
0xB3ECA849
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
0xC62F0668
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
0xEB5A4862
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
0x389A5F2E
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
0x844E06BC
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
0x4E97DE3A
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
0x51DE2641
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
0x5814B9E6
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
0x6BDA2754
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
0x12B89F46
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
0x0F347267
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
0x6D06D0C9

0xDB06C2B2
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
0x1264A8AC
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
0xC378DCC0
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
0xE83463F3
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
0x6B073FAD
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
0x64747B9A
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
0xB9B2018A
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
0x1A069B82
higher things.
0xE747AEA4

0xDB06C2B2
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
0xEF91AA89
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
0x8B95EB1D
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
0xE7839EF1
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
0xAA5B077A
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
0x75BFD74A
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
0xFE099803
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
0xADB669C1
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
0xD3FE90C3
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
0x8CD30A67
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
0x6EEA8849
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
0xF7A93D1C
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
0x148D1B90
alleviate.
0x46DF8812

0xDB06C2B2
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
0xD73E4178
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
0x886A8073
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
0xA94613A3
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
0x538FB93A
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
0x9CE9B3E8
verandah.
0x7F84EA6B

0xDB06C2B2
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
0x505F01CB
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
0x885452EB
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
0x8477F98B
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
0xC4D34EA4
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
0xA1A37ED6
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
0x90E22582
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
0x4311BC19
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
0x8566B266
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
0x8D0D5590
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
0x9A59EAF2
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
0x98AD9752
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
0x9F092696
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
0x1D77CFE1
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
0x68CC55C1
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
0xBF6421A0
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
0x0C002F96
done before:--
0x5BFCCF67

0xDB06C2B2
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
0x878D7DB3
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
0x44CE4BD2
have to go who knows where?"
0x94F930B9

0xDB06C2B2
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
0x765CCF98
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
0x00C4DB0A
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
0xC3B59141
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
0x9071FF5B
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
0xD8185C9E
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
0xBF19503A
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
0x96A51DB2
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
0x77E32F41
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
0x57DE54BA
ran up to her.
0x320B2611

0xDB06C2B2
"How is Helen Burns?"
0x03352AE1

0xDB06C2B2
"Very poorly," was the answer.
0x06F78C38

0xDB06C2B2
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
0x81593D6C

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"And what does he say about her?"
0x7B8640C4

0xDB06C2B2
"He says she'll not be here long."
0x75A65554

0xDB06C2B2
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
0xA8620E32
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
0xC7115D45
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
0x76107935
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
0xBA780147
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
0xAA0478BB
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
0x3511CCE9
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
0x63DF8BEB
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
0x698EC96E

0xDB06C2B2
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
0xF16CE06B

0xDB06C2B2
"May I go up and speak to her?"
0x79F6597D

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
0x46437D90
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
0x26B706C5

0xDB06C2B2
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
0x3AFFCEE3
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
0x2169985C
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
0xEAC0194B

0xDB06C2B2
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
0x9993F783
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
0x10F0C933
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
0x1AF90258
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
0xA04B4C5C
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
0x8D8E6668
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
0x9B619858
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
0x7BEA8CF7
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
0xB351D166
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
0xF6F18170
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
0x8C1ACBF3
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
0x130F030F
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
0x89421942
with her one last word.
0xED0E3AEB

0xDB06C2B2
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
0xA150576B
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
0x43F80F40
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
0xBEBAF318
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
0xC9FBE314
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
0xE6C7866E
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
0xA7222257
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
0x8605A5A9
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
0x5C862677
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
0x1E5D1FD8

0xDB06C2B2
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
0xBA085146
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
0x708A0018
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
0x29F1104F
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
0x5C784EA9
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
0xE32FF58C
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
0x6F37440C
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
0x2AF63C23
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
0xB5560AED
of seeing a corpse.
0xC028B13A

0xDB06C2B2
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
0xA4A6352B

0xDB06C2B2
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
0x1F6BA552
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
0x1992F4AD
instantly dissipated.
0x6ECB5415

0xDB06C2B2
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
0x2A645C7C

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
0x644E1483
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
0x3AFC7D80

0xDB06C2B2
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
0xCF1DA9C4
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
0x7EE3F8D9
old.
0xE95EB1AA

0xDB06C2B2
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
0x1961459E
strike some minutes since."
0x141758FD

0xDB06C2B2
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
0xA5E20226
sleep till I had spoken to you."
0x05D7C784

0xDB06C2B2
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
0xC6E99E33

0xDB06C2B2
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
0x6997E4DD

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
0xE3285460

0xDB06C2B2
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
0xAD9AF896
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
0xE5AA3D0E
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
0xDE8D8344
whispered--
0xF5DDEA4F

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
0x38B255E2
quilt."
0x16DC2F51

0xDB06C2B2
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
0xE7A1F720
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
0x9188FC35

0xDB06C2B2
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
0xC6AC5A7D
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
0x8B1F9B33
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
0x71615428
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
0x91A918E3
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
0xEEEE6376
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
0xAAC1292C
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
0xB8AB4DC0
been continually at fault."
0xD1BEE934

0xDB06C2B2
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
0xD02F8997

0xDB06C2B2
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
0xAD681435

0xDB06C2B2
"Where is God?  What is God?"
0xDB37AF3C

0xDB06C2B2
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
0xD36F4FB2
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
0xB73C5559
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
0x0375B944
reveal Him to me."
0xA44888AB

0xDB06C2B2
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
0x97592986
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
0xF5A859A5

0xDB06C2B2
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
0xA8726981
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
0x72A490EE
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
0x14D5A2C7

0xDB06C2B2
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
0x161F4114

0xDB06C2B2
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
0xC8FB638D
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
0x01C569B6

0xDB06C2B2
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
0x94D62A0E
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
0x51D58B22
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
0x4C737AB4
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
0x5C603E76
tone--
0x874842C9

0xDB06C2B2
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
0x0C14E844
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
0x80C01F59
near me."
0x07F3E49C

0xDB06C2B2
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
0xB3F542B4

0xDB06C2B2
"Are you warm, darling?"
0x74498B58

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"Good-night, Jane."
0x3D7E63B9

0xDB06C2B2
"Good-night, Helen."
0x97FB3AB3

0xDB06C2B2
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
0x73EB6DD1

0xDB06C2B2
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
0xAF71DCB4
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
0x8A2F38EA
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
0xC8E66FCF
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
0x3A89CE6F
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
0xF79D724F
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
0xAE44B0BA
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
0xA955F32D
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
0xD9EF3E13

0xDB06C2B2
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
0xFEDC3E4B
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
0x2EF5F4C5
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."

CHAPTER X
0xA404857D

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
0xDCF2D104
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
0x0E6CD975
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
0x21617AF5
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
0x39DB6DBB
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
0xB23DCE12
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
0xE5176818
connection.
0x138D5973

0xDB06C2B2
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
0xD0C9C0E2
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
0x4DB02C09
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
0xB850C8C8
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
0x3B0B0F62
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
0x083860C7
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
0x004A3FCA
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
0xB1162543
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
0x1665E9F0
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
0xF8CF6782
beneficial to the institution.
0x26FDFC86

0xDB06C2B2
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
0x34AB590A
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
0x270CD299
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
0xDDECD5B1
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
0x033B13B5
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
0xD2EF59D5
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
0x609A4F4A
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
0xDE1ED351
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
0x0C0D8BCF
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
0x06DF25B3
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
0x5254FF9C
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
0x6B124200
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
0xC86E45CE
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
0x96F90E64
testimony to its value and importance.
0xE67A22EA

0xDB06C2B2
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
0x71173FC1
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
0x52C1AA1C
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
0xB004E877
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
0x27B1C6FA
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
0x446CDD0C
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
0x9B1A8EDF
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
0xD823AEA0
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
0xF4709C10

0xDB06C2B2
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
0x9019AF33
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
0x469F292A
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
0x97869BE9
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
0x84D9172B
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
0x94E6DD4F
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
0xE066D1AB
county, and consequently was lost to me.
0xACA5D84F

0xDB06C2B2
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
0x520383E4
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
0x847DF2F5
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
0xBB03B1E2
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
0x2628A8F0
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
0x5639CA18
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
0xB025266F
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
0x9939A054
character.
0x77B492DC

0xDB06C2B2
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
0x8C28FEDC
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
0x75B61742
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
0x6C1DEF56
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
0x1735C6B5
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
0xD7ABF0E6
of the occasion.
0x8F65DDEA

0xDB06C2B2
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
0xDBE65CAB
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
0x98C4A930
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
0x027F19C5
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
0xD8A46CA7
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
0x50A10626
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
0x81BBEDEA
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
0x96DD8C84
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
0xE3D4AC7C
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
0xC9AD50BA
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
0xF9582116
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
0xF7953CEA
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
0x25FCA6C9
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
0x9A306C43
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
0x0C38EDD2
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
0x4C9C2000
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
0xC5B6BAE3

0xDB06C2B2
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
0x0CF604D4
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
0x99AE1228
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
0x123CBE94
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
0x92D0207C
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
0x089B1A2C
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
0xC7D88DE5
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
0x1D55AF64
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
0x5475A1A5
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
0x061A3956
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
0x178BCC83
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
0x111A86D7
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
0x25793506
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
0xB3653BE7
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
0xDEECCB94
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
0xB11293F0
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
0xEB00D7E2
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
0x1A6E71F9
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
0x78332F9A
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
0x9E24AF2B
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
0xA095DE2D
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
0x3272E235
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
0xBE20DDEC

0xDB06C2B2
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
0x4C6C72FE

0xDB06C2B2
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
0x1893AE5D
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
0x1AAD790A
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
0x5C0B0EC6
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
0x21E8E5E7
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
0xF89F1274
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
0xCE5FF126

0xDB06C2B2
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
0x4F60883E
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
0xB1DD44A5
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
0xC5584B48
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
0x6800F073
instantly revived.
0x0C5D70AD

0xDB06C2B2
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
0x2143C93B
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
0x1C4AFA9B
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
0x4877E799
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
0x1F527CAE
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
0x1E112024
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
0xCEA0A4B0
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
0xE8A5AC5F
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
0x953091D4
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
0xA66BA395
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
0x84F0D6F8

0xDB06C2B2
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
0x5F67686C
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
0xDC5A806E
think_ again with all my might.
0x7AB31F17

0xDB06C2B2
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
0x640EA75B
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
0xB4B09D56
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
0x29EDC892
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
0x99852AD6
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
0x8C1723EE
their resource?"
0x82E9439A

0xDB06C2B2
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
0x5A47D387
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
0xF1569B24
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
0x444E3634
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
0xAB5ABCE1
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
0x9556FD4A
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
0x9B996251

0xDB06C2B2
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
0x1F94DB48
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
0x65AEB4EA
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
0xB70B7B85
_---shire Herald_."
0x66F1C3F8

0xDB06C2B2
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
0xEA22D7F8

0xDB06C2B2
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--
0x1888F977

0xDB06C2B2
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
0xBDC91FC4
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first
0xAB848922
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed
0x3445E734
to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week
0x84583053
after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."
0x1445FEA2

0xDB06C2B2
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
0x68993103
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
0x788DFC0A

0xDB06C2B2
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
0x28EE0650
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
0xD50CB9F9

0xDB06C2B2
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
0x94E8E555
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
0x45966F34
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
0xDC49FDDC
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
0x044629C0
own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
0xC38AC7D2
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
0xE747A8E0
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
0xB9245C08
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---
0xB9AB3D5A
shire."
0x99D85552

0xDB06C2B2
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
0x59B50EE1
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
0x700644A2
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
0x3FDE41A5
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
0xCA36A64F
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
0xAFB008B0
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
0x0DFDB9ED
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
0xEDBD255D

0xDB06C2B2
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
0xC80F9D17
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
0xBF239DA1
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
0x148A8099
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
0x2ADC6887
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
0xB211EB01
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
0x730B095D
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
0x97095123

0xDB06C2B2
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
0xF6C76628
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
0x66F8F016
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
0x0D8AA9DD
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
0x4192AC30
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
0xD83FFD74

0xDB06C2B2
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
0xC4285865

0xDB06C2B2
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
0x18D7BA1C
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
0x586E8AFF
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
0xC7FCA872
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
0xC07D96E8
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
0xDA177881

0xDB06C2B2
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
0x96214461

0xDB06C2B2
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
0x0AF29CE0
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
0xEADC3BAB
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
0xE565BA48

0xDB06C2B2
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
0x2A9C5304
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
0xA763C420
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
0x27F0D713
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
0x145B5486
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
0xA705DFA8
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
0x174D98F1
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
0x9297F177
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
0x43B346C9
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
0x41045012
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
0xC012FA6B

0xDB06C2B2
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
0x4E326519
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give
0x21ED9657
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
0x12B550A4
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten
0xCFFC4915
years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is
0xC1BCE55B
requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the
0x0F4564B0
direction:--
0xFE1049C3

0xDB06C2B2
"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
0x8A873CA4

0xDB06C2B2
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
0x58220EE9
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
0x841AE13D
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
0xC3340DC9
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
0xB39DC92D
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
0xBF263597
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
0x03D7F9A7
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
0xCF139BE0
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
0xAA884C6B
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
0x778A2711
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
0x4AE00AF2
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
0xDBD2F058
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
0xAB447DF3
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
0xC056D95D
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
0x60090B5A
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
0x7499362C
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
0xD888E0E2
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
0xEE2DF214
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
0x793FA45C
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
0xAD5A7997
probably, be a good way from the town."
0x6856A5A2

0xDB06C2B2
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
0x8AE3E037

0xDB06C2B2
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
0xEA6862F9
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
0x7429AB48
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
0xD34162CA
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
0xB83CE1B5
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
0x351EAF0E
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
0xB23E3C3A
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
0x705B0BAF
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
0x7B9A7D9F
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
0xD4951E84
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
0x2C236763
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
0xC2706733
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
0x154BD9D3
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
0x73C03D59
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
0xD0977D00
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
0x396549A3
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
0x8FD936CD
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
0x6D844583
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
0x66EDB24C
forthwith be furnished me.
0x303A31E6

0xDB06C2B2
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
0x1D496908
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
0x6374A190
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
0xBE427113
assuming the post of governess in her house.
0xF8A29C6E

0xDB06C2B2
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
0x61C88595
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
0x33D0151D
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
0x2BD72EB7
years ago from Gateshead.
0xB554C178

0xDB06C2B2
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
0x985E6880
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
0x5DD959B3
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
0x4CAEC8E9
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
0x1B78124E
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
0xF42976AB
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
0x26514E40
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
0x67F11DFB
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
0x6D1C445A
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
0xC7E25311
while the change was being accomplished.
0x367438A2

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
0x4D140E93
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
0x0C209374

0xDB06C2B2
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
0x64763A48
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
0x5D5F0CF2
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
0xE197F026

0xDB06C2B2
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
0x2A68D8CA
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
0x6EC9FD4A

0xDB06C2B2
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
0x219174B2
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
0x52EB6707
complexion.
0xC54CF0DF

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
0x486C646F
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
0x0DA755B9

0xDB06C2B2
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
0x24C3B507
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
0x173E18BE
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
0x3922A2F0
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
0x70B47489

0xDB06C2B2
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
0x789D0861

0xDB06C2B2
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
0xA2FFF3A8

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
0x5618E637
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
0xC7E6142B

0xDB06C2B2
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
0x7B411147

0xDB06C2B2
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
0xE805BF0E

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
0xE61D35ED
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
0xFEEEAF9C
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
0x414676E0

0xDB06C2B2
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
0xE2F9641E
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
0xB2161111
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
0xF052FDB0
would make two of you in breadth."
0xB1E582B1

0xDB06C2B2
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
0xB4447A78

0xDB06C2B2
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
0x94949982
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
0x518993B1
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
0xCE9BBDC3
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
0x178114D4
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
0x9B9EF5E3
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
0x6755CE8A
quarrelling--"
0xAA8F9534

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
0xFE2CA6D5

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
0xE6BECBB2
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
0x9BF3B634
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
0xF401336C
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
0x5BE070A1

0xDB06C2B2
"What does he look like?"
0x169E6A9D

0xDB06C2B2
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
0x4C84A128
has such thick lips."
0x8AA51C0D

0xDB06C2B2
"And Mrs. Reed?"
0xD4B6243A

0xDB06C2B2
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
0xF166F1E9
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
0xF743F8DB
a deal of money."
0xBA593198

0xDB06C2B2
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
0x3D5C990D

0xDB06C2B2
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
0x38635EE1
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
0xB151BBD0
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
0xDE9096A8
you were quite out of my reach."
0xC1B707FE

0xDB06C2B2
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
0x5826AFF4
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
0xA74A7DA0
shape denote admiration.
0x93CA65B2

0xDB06C2B2
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
0x0BA12BB7
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
0xA46B9DF1
a child."
0x8D071412

0xDB06C2B2
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
0xABE87A20
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
0x7E5C58D1
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
0x499A75F9
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
0x06FB47CF

0xDB06C2B2
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
0xB4EA15AE
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
0x297C32AF

0xDB06C2B2
"A little."
0xD249EBE6

0xDB06C2B2
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
0x0F5EC097
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
0xAA78E4FD
charmed.
0x710646CC

0xDB06C2B2
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
0x13F575FF
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
0x98C219F7

0xDB06C2B2
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
0xFBFDE3A6
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
0xF3115235
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
0xE2578F36
and which she had framed and glazed.
0x697369C9

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
0x80B3669F
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
0x480C72E2
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
0x12B6D409

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
0x52BDB590

0xDB06C2B2
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
0xDFCD26C3

0xDB06C2B2
"I can."
0xA7A0FFE4

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
0xD076BE33
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
0x3280BDDE
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
0x4F2B592A
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
0x2D99E651

0xDB06C2B2
"Never in my life."
0x48405C60

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
0x58422D8F
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
0x34344ADA
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
0x227FEC0B
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
0xC23F8656
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
0x17FE9164
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
0x1795E352
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
0xDEAF0E04
father's brother."
0x13808F4C

0xDB06C2B2
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
0x13D3E257

0xDB06C2B2
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
0x83327F7C
tell me--"
0x296827DA

0xDB06C2B2
"Madeira?" I suggested.
0x9FFF0693

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
0xD04636ED

0xDB06C2B2
"So he went?"
0x84EE0C92

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
0x55F2EA40
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
0xEDD4813A
believes he was a wine-merchant."
0x14B7ACFE

0xDB06C2B2
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
0xF76E6853
wine-merchant."
0x0292FB71

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
0xFDE7A959
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
0x974153F1
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
0x23366B77
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
0xE31D3DF4
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
0x98D82435
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
0xE8EF4229
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.

0xDB06C2B2
CHAPTER XI
0x84679F64

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
0xF9E86208
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
0x04A25290
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
0x2D7F8C8C
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
0xECBFC536
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
0xE7C43C28
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
0x7745EF2B
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
0xF2631124
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
0xDC6AB0A8
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
0xA4286E7E
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
0x8E55A2F3
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
0x5F706D7F
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
0x03967A36

0xDB06C2B2
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
0x1F90F2B0
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
0x0A2A81EB
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
0x84A630C1
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
0xFFA672DC
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
0xBF8B6E3E
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
0x44C58451
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
0x171B568C
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
0x7BE2F94B
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
0x5D8FC488
troubling my thoughts.
0xFF9E6B21

0xDB06C2B2
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
0x4A414AF3
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
0x1E0DCB22
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
0xCDAF0885
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
0x54166D49
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
0x1A2B101E
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
0x59375B27
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
0x6644ABEF
the bell.
0x92E5ED3C

0xDB06C2B2
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
0xF3FE3D73
the waiter who answered the summons.
0x274CF27C

0xDB06C2B2
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
0xFD19B398
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
0x3D60B769

0xDB06C2B2
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
0x34046FA0

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"Person here waiting for you."
0x207CDD54

0xDB06C2B2
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
0x38A562B9
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
0xA0126845
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
0x256D8425

0xDB06C2B2
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
0x415DE582
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
0x397B1D74

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
0x5A28B462
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
0xF0BBB1EF
Thornfield.
0x38A43756

0xDB06C2B2
"A matter of six miles."
0x60BB2ED2

0xDB06C2B2
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
0xF32B19E7

0xDB06C2B2
"Happen an hour and a half."
0xAE954905

0xDB06C2B2
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
0x0C6B4D2C
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
0x59C1BCAD
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
0x70E22DD5
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
0x243CFCD9
much at my ease.
0x77E45712

0xDB06C2B2
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
0x7E56DE7E
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
0x6117855E
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
0xAC243FE7
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
0x027F880E
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
0x97DFD2F2
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
0x3E135399
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
0xB6F60A10
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
0x292591CD
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
0x9E13D876
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
0x1FD76C25
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
0x14CD6178
road now, I wonder?"
0xBA6251DF

0xDB06C2B2
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
0x0B235A2B
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
0xD35F68CF
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
0xA1D8AE37
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
0x9878E809
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
0x7874D3EE
more stirring, less romantic.
0xCAAB9A88

0xDB06C2B2
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
0x46A93238
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
0xBD4739FD
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
0xF83328D3

0xDB06C2B2
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
0x56A29192

0xDB06C2B2
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
0x543C4C86
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
0x82B35B1C
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
0xF050A7B6
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
0x648D1CC5
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
0xF46EDF1A
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
0x2ECC75EA
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
0x3A754A44
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
0x4F33C82B

0xDB06C2B2
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
0x7187BABB
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
0xC93560C7
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
0xBDDB0F4F
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
0xE96970CD
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
0xCBBDD98F
itself to my view.
0xBB320977

0xDB06C2B2
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
0x424C4090
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
0x50EB2859
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
0xD48C66EA
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
0x9E8ADEF9
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
0x54E7466A
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
0x85582A8E
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
0xC16713CA
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
0xE6DE4244
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
0x202A99B7
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
0x3AA68AB0

0xDB06C2B2
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
0x3E418E08
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
0x03BA0124

0xDB06C2B2
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
0xAEDFF3D8

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
0x718CEB26

0xDB06C2B2
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
0xD52D5F18
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
0x718ECFEA
trouble.
0xDF20FC24

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
0x86A58910
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
0x4EB6A08C
the keys of the storeroom."
0xD1D0C7BE

0xDB06C2B2
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
0x8B73B8A1
delivered them to the servant.
0x6508DBB7

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
0xCDB0CB3D
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
0x767F7729

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, ma'am."
0x858D7181

0xDB06C2B2
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
0xF75B952B

0xDB06C2B2
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
0xB1CF5127
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
0x4BE447CF
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
0x1ACC6703
too soon."
0xFFB533EA

0xDB06C2B2
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
0x8FAAAC38
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
0x48515F7B
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
0x63BF60F1
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
0xF82F4138
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
0xD4F7513E
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
0x14C71E43
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
0x3809F641

0xDB06C2B2
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
0x6A300994
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
0x097434A6

0xDB06C2B2
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
0xFC11D10A
approaching her ear to my mouth.
0x46030F59

0xDB06C2B2
I repeated the question more distinctly.
0xDCE224E4

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
0xB7DC231E
future pupil."
0x5EAA169E

0xDB06C2B2
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
0xAC26D3C3

0xDB06C2B2
"No,--I have no family."
0x4A3BC3ED

0xDB06C2B2
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
0xFC2FDF6C
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
0x13E3F317
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
0x125682C7

0xDB06C2B2
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
0x79A4B792
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
0x3E7680A0
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
0x2A16F83C
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
0x9E47E8B7
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
0x08B74397
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
0x1731BDF5
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
0x0E99BAD2
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
0x9B08EC28
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
0x89D15A0D
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
0x438D48A6
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
0xE8358445
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
0x29CEAC35
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
0xA7AB979C
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
0xA25DBB55
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
0xD40E2DEA
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
0x147C9ED9
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
0x96318E33
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
0x01007D4F
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
0x48FBAF01

0xDB06C2B2
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
0xB8DA6E27
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
0x6CA3D922
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
0x9955916B

0xDB06C2B2
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
0xD8EE2661
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
0xCC5DDA49
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
0x6A4B33A0
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
0xF2C27E86
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
0xE984BBA4
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
0x43547CC9
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
0xD3BA3CD3

0xDB06C2B2
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
0xDA66EDBC
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
0x4B83FD92
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
0x2A3E286D
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
0x75660FFD
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
0xF253BEE7
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
0x56F1F3B6
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
0x8440CFF6
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
0x00000D16
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
0x755AE397
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
0x2C8F64BB
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
0x9C0EB9FA

0xDB06C2B2
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
0x9D0D7EBA
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
0x39E0FFD5
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
0xAAA7138D
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
0xBAE759EB
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
0xB4146880
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
0xAC0AD4C6
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
0x00634502
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
0xF1957434
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
0x824313AB
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
0xAC87AD88
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
0x2B686AE7
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
0x31E8DFC2

0xDB06C2B2
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
0x34EAE1B5
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
0xB606FDC5
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
0x4B5E361C
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
0x178A6E40
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
0xF660EE14
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
0x1CEDA984
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
0xEB697704
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
0x1BF73FED
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
0x0D9D95EE
an indefinite future period.
0xAF933B2D

0xDB06C2B2
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
0x017EEBAF
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
0xECCEFA2F
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
0xBD6BC902
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
0x46D677C2
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
0xC8F3E444
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
0x90B6B0C2
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
0x4CB39691
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
0x45CAEAEF
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
0x26541231
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
0xC11780C6
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
0x5A931754
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
0x867BEF04
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
0x54104E8F
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
0x6518DDFE
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
0xD486EA24
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
0x058D5F32
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
0xD0CF396E
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
0xCADD1FEE
toilet table, I ventured forth.
0x864F2B6C

0xDB06C2B2
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
0x42E7C0E3
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
0x2AE54C13
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
0xC3DBFE29
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
0x3D8F4990
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
0xE1E91F7F
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
0x87CAC23D
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
0x6522918B
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
0x6E87D3A4
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
0x858F7B98
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
0x009894D6
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
0x2977F57B
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
0x110C499E
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
0x35C26043
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
0x643785A9
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
0x281E5E7A
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
0x718151DF
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
0x39225FDD
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
0xB3399017
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
0xEA31801B
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
0x9234E835
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
0x77E4DCCB
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
0x25799162
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
0x5EAFB6A6
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
0x85C555D6
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
0xAAB7ECD3
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
0xA87C56FD
house and gates.
0xD23FD91C

0xDB06C2B2
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
0x6BBB5810
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
0x92AF81AB
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
0x97BC36F6
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
0xD89CD74F
appeared at the door.
0x94C6C135

0xDB06C2B2
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
0x7D885D4F
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
0x7B2346C4

0xDB06C2B2
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
0xBD7D6C56
much.
0xA1AAE003

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
0x1BEBB164
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
0xE03EAEA0
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
0x7504F02D
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
0x0DD91C1E

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
0xF1DCF103

0xDB06C2B2
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
0xE2643449
was called Rochester?"
0x5CEC2F2D

0xDB06C2B2
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
0x4EE519E6
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
0x6F7592EA
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
0x2570DC1D

0xDB06C2B2
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
0x75B95DDB

0xDB06C2B2
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
0xAC87C165
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
0x50AE6DB1
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
0xA902F63A
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
0xCE6E7E62
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
0x889243B4
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
0xC2BA2773
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
0x44BAF86C
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
0x6836C24E
expect nothing more."
0x729E90AE

0xDB06C2B2
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
0x4DD164CC

0xDB06C2B2
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
0x615607B7
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
0x88786EE9
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
0x5CAB7628
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
0x21012C33
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
0xC6D3207C
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
0xB67703AC
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
0x3584D6C5
the better--my position was all the freer.
0xBCA4F943

0xDB06C2B2
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
0x85BF023F
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
0x6ED38286
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
0xCD4F4761
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
0x56D45631
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
0x64449A6A

0xDB06C2B2
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
0xB2ADE32A
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
0x6F9F4D82
approached.
0x506AEF5F

0xDB06C2B2
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
0xE1F9EA5B
nurse; who answered--
0xBB744DC3

0xDB06C2B2
"Mais oui, certainement."
0x7EE34CA5

0xDB06C2B2
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
0xB5577F0F

0xDB06C2B2
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
0x9EFD3A67
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
0xD59B0ED9
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
0x98418889
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
0x22C647D6
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
0x8E2F7EE3

0xDB06C2B2
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
0x1180FE13
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
0xBBE27C47
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
0x6ECAD775
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
0x680ADD3B
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
0x4858B5A8
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
0x06998765
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
0xC61A688F
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
0xD2C3C6F8
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
0x0B092208
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
0xDF7B8440
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
0x62A5DC7D
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
0x4A599DF1

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
0x924DE6E7
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
0x14760D81
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
0x10AC3518
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
0x927B84C7
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
0x4AA18063
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
0x8BCEE894
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
0x6379B97D
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
0x8094086E
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
0x2E7E2076

0xDB06C2B2
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
0x6D1ED512

0xDB06C2B2
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
0x3C88423E
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
0x2367D1D4
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
0x5FDBA573
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
0xEF4990BD
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
0xE4E47A4D
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
0xB21E0D51
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
0x99912736
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
0x3A96615E
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
0xC8D54F11
fed with crumbs."
0x61262304

0xDB06C2B2
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
0xE767170B

0xDB06C2B2
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
0x2850E924
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
0xCF671A1D

0xDB06C2B2
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
0x00F2B2D2
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
0x41102414

0xDB06C2B2
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
0xD3ED630A
clean town you spoke of?"
0x574D25CF

0xDB06C2B2
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
0x2EA55ACE
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
0x3EE01879
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
0x154A2D6C
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
0x886BF63B
hear me sing now?"
0x8602C0EA

0xDB06C2B2
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
0x29B5CA0A
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
0xD46A14BC
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
0x152F9787
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
0x6EF64881
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
0xC7BA50B5
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
0x5419946D
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
0x4EDAB7DE
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
0x3305CE88
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
0x2E6D740C
affected her.
0xF71FBD04

0xDB06C2B2
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
0x9F70B3CD
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
0x541516F5
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
0x22FF9CF9
at least I thought so.
0x3B75DEE7

0xDB06C2B2
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
0x49BBD565
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
0x91D24AB5
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
0x5269E308

0xDB06C2B2
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
0x6D6D6D93
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
0xF0668694
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
0x0015F9A2
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
0xF9825597
carefully trained.
0x90E1BE7D

0xDB06C2B2
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
0xFD645055

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
0xA7FDA95F
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
0x4A8DE0AC
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
0xE9F5D128

0xDB06C2B2
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
0x251E3B0F
say, with whom did you live then?"
0xAA23C0B1

0xDB06C2B2
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
0x695E5988
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
0x71E2FE63
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
0x01A11D72
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
0x9483FCD9
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
0xD3B491B5
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
0x42CA2FBA
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
0xBD185942
and I never see him."
0x6A9A61C3

0xDB06C2B2
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
0x277C70D1
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
0x71538708
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
0x04E91C29
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
0x4FF3FA4F
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
0xB92583DC
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
0x5D332912
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
0xD5AE8964
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
0x09046688
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
0x69181804
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
0x2D1D13BE
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
0x97C507BA
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
0xBF33C492

0xDB06C2B2
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
0x1B9CCDA8
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
0x9B67FE2D
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
0x67470519
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
0x022731CA
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
0x38D365B4
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
0x3E8420B3
use.
0xD0881B97

0xDB06C2B2
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
0x4C63F1F5
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
0xF95E326D
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
0xF4CD59A6
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
0x2B73AA00
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
0xEED43BEA
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
0x2500A2D4
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
0xF2F83DA3
sideboard.
0x9711C3E9

0xDB06C2B2
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
0x6CB8F4D2
before seen any half so imposing.
0xBED9A068

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
0x5812BA13
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
0xD071B5B5
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
0xA5AAB0EC

0xDB06C2B2
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
0xC2EC358D
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
0x15DF81A9
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
0x3D7802CC
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
0x704EC456
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
0x0CC9E268
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
0x290E189B
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
0x4A49DF61
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
0x0A7A5A4C
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
0xB869A7D5
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
0xA7A0FCE2
general blending of snow and fire.
0xB0C31779

0xDB06C2B2
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
0x2ACE26BD
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
0x66633047
were inhabited daily."
0x4040B7DB

0xDB06C2B2
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
0x7404B73F
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
0xE0F0CDDC
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
0x77AE9547
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
0xD9B06596

0xDB06C2B2
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
0xF9E57A96

0xDB06C2B2
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
0xC2726647
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
0x12AD4C7D

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
0x7907C3ED

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
0x045FFBC1
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
0xC015A416
Rochesters time out of mind."
0x3FDBC470

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
0x0DA1C584
liked for himself?"
0x0DF0723A

0xDB06C2B2
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
0x764A9DBD
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
0x2057A726
lived much amongst them."
0x47616A12

0xDB06C2B2
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
0x1E35D8F8

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
0x468D8E9D
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
0x58158219
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
0x9BD6F9AB
conversation with him."
0x9B0B8E8C

0xDB06C2B2
"In what way is he peculiar?"
0x5C3F0198

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
0xA8F484A6
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
0x96FB38EC
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
0x227329AA
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
0x528AF614
he is a very good master."
0xA1E1C792

0xDB06C2B2
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
0xA5FDB0F1
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
0xD6ADD4D8
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
0x752BD050
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
0xDA12A9A8
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
0x1D24EA2A
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
0xE6B5FD24
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
0x76655E36
definite notion of his identity.
0x5C206732

0xDB06C2B2
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
0x6342F8CA
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
0x2E9285C2
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
0xD4F1D74F
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
0xE84129B4
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
0x93C174F8
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
0x35755784
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
0x6D359017
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
0xC886906E
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
0xF80877EA
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
0xEC0A2CB4
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
0x14989320
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
0xC1AC7DF6
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
0x32DEF927
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
0x5142D24B
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
0xA8693CE1
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
0x646FF69D
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
0x353D3E9D
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
0xDC2A4210
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
0xF04E794A
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
0xC1B2C756
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
0xBC016698

0xDB06C2B2
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
0x83178BEC

0xDB06C2B2
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
0x8A4B989D
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
0x4AC293B0
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
0xA518CC4F

0xDB06C2B2
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
0x94C3EC94

0xDB06C2B2
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
0x83D2F81B

0xDB06C2B2
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
0x29243690

0xDB06C2B2
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
0x2E4926D4
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
0x94560843
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
0x02554364

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
0xACC0B5B2
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
0x14779B6E

0xDB06C2B2
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
0x7D5A58FE
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
0xDD3B7B3D
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
0x6135475E
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
0x3219902B
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
0x65EC96D5
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
0x1D95D3BE
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
0x73AD35FF
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
0x3227B248
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
0x3C5B5A17
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
0x37511D0E
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
0x6953E92F
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
0x4C3ECE43
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
0x0642FA29
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
0xE01A60D5
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
0x7D716C03
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
0x0A937A0F
over which I had been gazing with delight.
0x253FE897

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
0x4FA191C3
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
0xFF59C62F
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
0xD90D6AF4
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
0xA45DA986
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
0x449FF1DE
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
0xFF52AEFE
Bluebeard's castle.
0xFE5EEA8F

0xDB06C2B2
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
0x48C979EC
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
0x64E8F0FB
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
0x9018EA5D
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
0xE344C81C
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
0xCFC36CC0
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
0xB7481461
out the door whence the accents issued.
0xF0AD4C2E

0xDB06C2B2
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
0x3433E854
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
0x36CC0BCF

0xDB06C2B2
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
0x212C6307

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
0xD398ABD6

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
0x1567F9D5
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
0x6294E130

0xDB06C2B2
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
0xDF82C8DC
odd murmur.
0xBB71F9B3

0xDB06C2B2
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
0x6B532067

0xDB06C2B2
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
0xA05E5B08
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
0x96F95032
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
0xBF4E15E7
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
0x9E042086
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
0xDC17EC0B
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
0x7F195DD5

0xDB06C2B2
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
0xA3A2BDDB
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
0x97796EBC
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
0x6672BAD4
be conceived.
0x4797A29E

0xDB06C2B2
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
0x987099EB
curtseyed silently and went in.
0xD9F83E91

0xDB06C2B2
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
0x0016FB05
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
0x072FA724
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
0x36D27E1E
pupil this morning?"
0x33D7CD0B

0xDB06C2B2
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
0xA6318CA9
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
0x2AFE6C26
hall, exclaiming--
0x0A861124

0xDB06C2B2
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
0x61FC590C

0xDB06C2B2
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.

CHAPTER XII
0x1D89E464

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
0x9F67227B
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
0x2FE5AA42
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
0x37846670
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
0x61F21F3F
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
0x6486FB62
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
0xAE540B01
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
0xF7BCB306
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
0x596174D6
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
0xDA19040B
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
0xF0B6C923
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
0xB88D45A9
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
0xCC91C28C
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
0x0758146C
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
0x166BD1BB
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
0x4616E54C
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
0x96640E53

0xDB06C2B2
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
0x476B3CAA
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
0xC6001917
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
0x99D54162
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
0x915D991E
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
0xEC0F01BE
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
0x578BD296
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
0x7339A576
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
0x608637CD
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
0x14AB0720
of her mind and character.
0xDE68FB3A

0xDB06C2B2
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
0xDF797930
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
0x16CFF0D3
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
0x9AF23ABA
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
0x85C7C6A1
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
0xB63C051F
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
0x31FD7D97
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
0x7BF4D7ED
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
0xE50C357B
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
0x0086AC59
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
0x43ED022D
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
0x201A2BB6
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
0x8BAA8DE3
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
0x7E68549C
what I believed in I wished to behold.
0x5EACCF93

0xDB06C2B2
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
0x5EB31A64
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
0x56D28A5A
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
0x46BE1606
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
0x4291A2B1
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
0x94226AB7
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
0x1EDC7676
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
0x0A97949D
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
0x11463474
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
0x7A84B368
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
0xC185B094
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
0x276BD67A

0xDB06C2B2
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
0xF84E798A
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
0xE2800252
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
0x71E9A0FE
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
0x20C4FAC5
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
0x29FE6B4C
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
0x33A13871
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
0x5F01870F
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
0xD4C4F664
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
0xCF731A6B
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
0xAC87591C
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
0xF22A15B6
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
0x55DEB831
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
0xCCB80442
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
0xD86E539C

0xDB06C2B2
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
0x44A1EE11
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
0x649ED196
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
0xF73EDE5A
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
0xD495F807
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
0x51FBADEF
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
0x437FAAD5
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
0x2F741207
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
0x4E662C9A
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
0xB7521986
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
0xFDA7AED8
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
0xD1B58C36
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
0x72390AB4
every effort of that sort.
0x72779643

0xDB06C2B2
The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
0x9B534B3F
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
0x21C669A7
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
0xA298E86D
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
0x91FE1341
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
0x87B493BE
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.
0x0DBD07D3

0xDB06C2B2
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
0x3E2E9640
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
0x9F59CE9C
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
0x68909A27
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
0xD5A99AA1
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
0x7AE36505
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
0x98E540D3
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
0x5379CF47
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
0xE903B3AB
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
0xFF3A3DA4
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
0x129D49C8
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
0xA0CAD70B
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
0xA6A1DFA8
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
0x8CC2525F
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
0x6CD1DC70
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
0x57DB44C5

0xDB06C2B2
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
0x7DDA833B
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
0xFF874112
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
0x6DF1A3FB
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
0x1706C4F9
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
0x3352186F
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
0x8103EE92
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
0x64EE274D
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
0x835948D2
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
0xDA85A048
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
0xA4037902
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
0x45BB1D14
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
0x6242BCEC
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
0x7A9CC302
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
0xDD0D9877
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
0x0E335E88

0xDB06C2B2
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
0xCD368BAB
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
0xE0F82BDA
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
0x42A2DD66
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
0x6909AFE3
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
0xA758118E
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
0x3AAB55D4
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
0xA13E2978
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
0xB825AA5F
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
0xB2E4F0E6
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
0xB478E011

0xDB06C2B2
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
0x6A8AEB5D
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
0xE1502F43
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
0x7385E14D
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
0xD3493C97
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
0x5D57C64B
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
0x9F9C2DD6
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
0x96A10E11
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
0x3A4788C3

0xDB06C2B2
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
0xFB5F7A97
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
0xEED1989C
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
0x7DDB9A8B
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
0xF02A0A1E
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
0x540CACE0
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
0x6D1AD2F8

0xDB06C2B2
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
0x298655E1
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
0xB758EFA5
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
0x109218DF
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
0x6C282423
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
0x33C53DA8
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
0x40D5C20A
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
0x07EBAF34
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
0x6858101D
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
0xB9A64D7F
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
0x6A7B1965
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
0x259249F2
me.
0x23A34F09

0xDB06C2B2
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
0x079D6D30
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
0xAC9C6627
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
0x390A6F7F
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
0x21360F1E
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
0xD6730943
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
0x073E771E
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
0xC32D0A44
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
0xAF1FD406
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
0x60974AF0
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
0xE512E4FC
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
0xEC07C93B
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
0x9DA40CCD
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
0xB80905A0
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
0xD1590BD0
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
0x87F694C7
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
0x9D5DB487
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
0x4FD64BA4
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
0x9F69BA13
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
0xDD5DC7CF
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
0xA949400C
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
0xA705ACC6
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
0x966416CF
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
0x077059BA

0xDB06C2B2
"Are you injured, sir?"
0x28C53C37

0xDB06C2B2
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
0xAB6AD7E3
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
0xEB58A038

0xDB06C2B2
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
0x6458B2A6

0xDB06C2B2
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
0xFDE610DD
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
0x6B53AE55
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
0x21DEADB0
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
0x9EDD9F7E
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
0x8B171174
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
0x7507BED0
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
0x898D28A8
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
0x02BD1017
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
0xAC69965D

0xDB06C2B2
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
0x3FE22DC5
now drew near him again.
0x530F1523

0xDB06C2B2
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
0x782EF883
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
0x176AB1A6

0xDB06C2B2
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
0x9EB2378A
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
0xD56A12CB
involuntary "Ugh!"
0x71DDEEF0

0xDB06C2B2
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
0x5907284C
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
0xA33A579F
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
0xDD772D0F
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
0x06C0D953
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
0x84ED2204
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
0xE2030E1A
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
0x042E142B
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
0x04135A28
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
0x0987973F
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
0xE07FAF4C
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
0x4C71B62C
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
0xE2B3FC59
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
0xC0C2C372
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
0xF498C8DD
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
0x004A0460
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
0x37C31E29

0xDB06C2B2
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
0x24D68ECB
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
0x090D083D
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
0x56D33434
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
0x3F995DBE
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
0xDC705318

0xDB06C2B2
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
0x3D07EAFA
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
0x8E5A886D

0xDB06C2B2
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
0x4AEC0B43
direction before.
0x8877564F

0xDB06C2B2
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
0x51822ED7
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
0x13E33F3C

0xDB06C2B2
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
0x229BB10B
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
0x0E803F7C
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
0xE70C31BD

0xDB06C2B2
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
0x125F739B
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
0x7F44DA91
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
0x4DA8EF56
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
0x1655A363

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"Whose house is it?"
0x159F9EFC

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester's."
0x78B8FF46

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
0xE20CB3B6

0xDB06C2B2
"No, I have never seen him."
0xA6D3472E

0xDB06C2B2
"He is not resident, then?"
0x20302DEB

0xDB06C2B2
"No."
0xBB39FC9B

0xDB06C2B2
"Can you tell me where he is?"
0x72B4EF8A

0xDB06C2B2
"I cannot."
0xBC80600E

0xDB06C2B2
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
0xEF25CF2D
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
0x46FA41F9
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
0x13DB7B1E
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
0x84E9A255

0xDB06C2B2
"I am the governess."
0xE2C980FE

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
0x7C6E6AE1
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
0xB1C9C681
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
0x9EBC554E

0xDB06C2B2
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a
0xD59674D0
little yourself, if you will be so kind."
0x6BF0E5D7

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
0xAA487A1E

0xDB06C2B2
"No."
0xBB39FC9B

0xDB06C2B2
"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
0x539A6084
afraid?"
0xC31CE82E

0xDB06C2B2
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
0x119CBD19
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
0x6D01A722
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
0xA610418E
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
0xBB5A8CD4
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
0x514700A0
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
0x3E6DF9C4
he laughed.
0x7C8767B3

0xDB06C2B2
{I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet: p107.jpg}
0xE44257C2

0xDB06C2B2
"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
0xE53C0839
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
0xB5DBF138
come here."
0xAFE6E499

0xDB06C2B2
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
0x6EE03664
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
0xA3ABB795
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
0x5ED57B8D
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
0xAF540258
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
0x9D6932F3

0xDB06C2B2
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
0xE458FEA7
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
0xCBABE3B1

0xDB06C2B2
I sought it and found it.
0x9B5F470A

0xDB06C2B2
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
0x8A4EDDE5
you can."
0xD4263006

0xDB06C2B2
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
0xC56FB904
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
0xE7CAC720

0xDB06C2B2
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
0x1490950B
   The wild wind whirls away."
0xD42E6350

0xDB06C2B2
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
0xD5A3B1B3
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
0x905FAAA0
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
0x26F9EFBB
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
0xBBFCCEA7
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
0x6BF17CF1
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
0x42CEF125
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
0x58DC8373
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
0x09D10482
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
0xE7353797
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
0xBFD3C888
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
0x2BE90D76
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
0x3FF354AF
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
0x17DFC6DE
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
0xD643BFAC
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
0xB70F4249
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
0x55C5B545
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
0x1F225A3C
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
0x56CECF36
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
0xB7439737
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
0x825C3F7C

0xDB06C2B2
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
0x5543783C
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
0xB680DF14
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
0x03818C73
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
0x430DE9F0
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
0x641A8D50
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
0xB1347543
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
0x17778561
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
0xE8F77E0B
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
0x58722CD8
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
0x43FB749C
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
0x40260E87
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
0x6695C6D1
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
0xC5762DF1
as it would be under his.
0x8E4B64D4

0xDB06C2B2
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
0xEA1FFE0C
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
0xA5B1877D
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
0x955DC34C
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
0x16281F67
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
0x0AC4C2E2
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
0xD5E6D2A7
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
0x90E526F8
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
0x828A6E53
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
0xDCB9304E
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
0x9AD1BA71
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
0x8B467EDC
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
0xE0F48EEE
door, and went in.
0x7BA5227E

0xDB06C2B2
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
0xC82ED239
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
0x63F598F8
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
0xA8951A8E
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
0xADB0F621
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
0x389A01D6
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
0xE37B986C
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
0x0D88F76F
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
0x0DC71A49
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
0x4B8D149C

0xDB06C2B2
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
0x18C40465
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
0xCB42FF34
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
0x4E616B96
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
0xBC1F75F2
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
0x39D1D197
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
0x29FB107F
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
0x86454E49
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
0x8347518C
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
0xC0FC9AC6

0xDB06C2B2
"What dog is this?"
0x9FA0E0DE

0xDB06C2B2
"He came with master."
0x814A1456

0xDB06C2B2
"With whom?"
0x630D056E

0xDB06C2B2
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."
0x197236AD

0xDB06C2B2
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
0x96D98A66

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
0x4462BBE7
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
0x905FD954
sprained."
0xA5CAD47A

0xDB06C2B2
"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
0x79C31027

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
0x207B7061

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
0xE7A1937A

0xDB06C2B2
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
0x0A73F576
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
0x3D8B876A
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
0xDE040F31
upstairs to take off my things.

CHAPTER XIII
0x2AF228AC

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
0x4D0B4291
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
0x07720FBE
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
0xE21A5E03
and waiting to speak with him.
0xF9763EB9

0xDB06C2B2
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
0x518E9534
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
0x763AF382
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
0x483A4369
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
0x14C801CE
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
0x951E8D9D
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
0x3131A394
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
0xBE562F52
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
0xA13885C5
master: for my part, I liked it better.
0x5861FCD5

0xDB06C2B2
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
0x02CD315C
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
0xE418AE5B
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
0xD6634F40
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
0xD02A7B5E
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
0xEBB41286
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
0x496D8B61
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
0x9C7AAB01
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
0x5FC1470F
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
0x4393BA4C
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
0x225E71D1
box in whose contents she had an interest.
0xE9BAA4CC

0xDB06C2B2
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
0x9096ED9A
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
0x30282BF9
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
0x792457D0
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
0x90FA04F8
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
0x9C0BC3F5

0xDB06C2B2
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
0x9641F1B2
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
0x9C330453
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
0x8B71A1BD
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
0x9E2BCD26
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
0x3780AC71
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
0x2AB5DDEA
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
0xA5575AFA
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
0x9A8BD99B
fireside.
0xB3F6AF0C

0xDB06C2B2
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
0x18835656
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
0x4589AC2F
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
0x35411F03
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
0x273DED70
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
0x1B75E187

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
0x1A299A18
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
0xE1376EAF
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
0xE01CDE34

0xDB06C2B2
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
0x2C98E917

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
0xA50AEDD6
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
0x84811E35
candle."
0x8C94648D

0xDB06C2B2
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
0x47777E1F

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
0xE5CACC1E
is here."
0x78684225

0xDB06C2B2
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
0xB6066E80
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
0x72554C08
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
0x277FFBBE
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
0x180ABF23
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
0xA8469977

0xDB06C2B2
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
0xFD3F5123
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
0xF781395B
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
0x0DDE4CCF
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
0x626D994F
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
0xD3191513
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
0x5818EC63
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
0x3C0E370C

0xDB06C2B2
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
0x56F6C746
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
0x1A6AA5E2
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
0x72A152DF
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
0xFA6009BA
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
0xA70D710B
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
0x374E8C4D
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
0x64EAA48C
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
0x48F1CE73
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
0xB04ED6AC
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
0x64704696
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
0x4F3DE780
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
0xC2E20C75
neither tall nor graceful.
0xC85BEA4F

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
0x6B1588E8
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
0x4A00CAF6
lifted his head as we approached.
0xAE436C68

0xDB06C2B2
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
0xEECE2CFA
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
0x8973101A

0xDB06C2B2
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
0x4A6686DF
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
0x91F92FA4
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
0x0C9DC701
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
0xBE6A51CE

0xDB06C2B2
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
0xEC5E838B
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
0x19DC50C1
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
0x3047B7AF
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
0x603D2634
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
0x16C9142C
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
0x1130D7DE

0xDB06C2B2
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
0xEA174E11
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
0x808AB5B4
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
0x26D75FD6
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
0x13E8211E
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
0xA39DDA31
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
0x1F50D8B9

0xDB06C2B2
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
0xDF21E20D
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
0x3F80A5E6
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
0x0784CFE5
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
0xFD83BC1F

0xDB06C2B2
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
0x4D70C2C5
might perhaps spill it."
0x9D33A830

0xDB06C2B2
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
0xB45BFD05
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
0x3B3B65F5

0xDB06C2B2
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
0x1A503668
votre petit coffre?"
0x330BF639

0xDB06C2B2
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
0x50B9A6A9
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
0x407A21EB
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
0x5E7BF015

0xDB06C2B2
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
0x4D0ABFEF
thought pleasant things."
0xABBB5170

0xDB06C2B2
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
0xA04697E9

0xDB06C2B2
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
0x016C14A6
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
0x0D3A3310
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
0xB5B8334B
nature."
0x22204636

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
0x50F01FAE
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
0xEBE6AA7B

0xDB06C2B2
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
0xBE83AC0C
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
0xBB673990
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
0x7BB541D4
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
0xC9BC450F
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
0x4201AAEE

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
0x6B74D284
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
0x55842599
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
0xEC6307E9

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
0xED10EF84
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
0x910CCEC2

0xDB06C2B2
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
0xD2CBBE57

0xDB06C2B2
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
0x9FC8BC28
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
0x35D61911
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
0x03B6F6DF
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
0xFA0CCFEA
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
0x42F8CFE7
amuse herself with Pilot.
0x915CCF00

0xDB06C2B2
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
0x0D37875E

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"And you came from--?"
0xBDFDB928

0xDB06C2B2
"From Lowood school, in ---shire."
0x95DB8748

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
0xCC70BA45

0xDB06C2B2
"Eight years."
0xC413272F

0xDB06C2B2
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
0x0320B4CA
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
0x7E49E386
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
0xC8727019
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
0x79BE5F72
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
0x337C1D60
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"
0xF8B57D5B

0xDB06C2B2
"I have none."
0xABE290B6

0xDB06C2B2
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
0x5AE60231

0xDB06C2B2
"No."
0xBB39FC9B

0xDB06C2B2
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
0xA1B6ED82
that stile?"
0x2875EA31

0xDB06C2B2
"For whom, sir?"
0x239C8EBF

0xDB06C2B2
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
0x4CC7A3F7
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the
0x166AB239
causeway?"
0x11F64D39

0xDB06C2B2
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
0xF8B7EF7E
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
0xCDF0F39D
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
0xDF796B32
think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their
0x671E1309
revels more."
0x6F308082

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
0x9413AB3D
wondering what sort of talk this was.
0x5B2997CA

0xDB06C2B2
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
0xFD07D796
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
0x754FB06E

0xDB06C2B2
"No; none that I ever saw."
0xF1388CC2

0xDB06C2B2
"And your home?"
0x63D95F76

0xDB06C2B2
"I have none."
0xABE290B6

0xDB06C2B2
"Where do your brothers and sisters live?"
0x39A1B08A

0xDB06C2B2
"I have no brothers or sisters."
0x983D48E1

0xDB06C2B2
"Who recommended you to come here?"
0xB9772800

0xDB06C2B2
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
0x70E7DD4F

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
0xCB7895A7
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
0xA114B657
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to
0x892BEA85
Adele."
0x9C95B49C

0xDB06C2B2
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
0x1B219E2B
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
0xD3D9752C
felling my horse."
0x96D4F204

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
0x6268A63B

0xDB06C2B2
"I have to thank her for this sprain."
0x6DE955D9

0xDB06C2B2
The widow looked bewildered.
0x7515A05E

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
0x00C152AA

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir."
0x3690D484

0xDB06C2B2
"Have you seen much society?"
0x4D191587

0xDB06C2B2
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
0xF50C56B5
Thornfield."
0xD4200FB4

0xDB06C2B2
"Have you read much?"
0xA40C8E8A

0xDB06C2B2
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
0xA987C883
very learned."
0x81D14D07

0xDB06C2B2
"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
0x78F5C42A
religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
0xB7B84EAA
parson, is he not?"
0xB1DB60CF

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
0x4F9F2D27
would worship their director."
0x93E19025

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, no."
0x744436E9

0xDB06C2B2
"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
0x64A94B26
sounds blasphemous."
0xD4BD469A

0xDB06C2B2
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
0x1A906FAB
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
0x5582AEBB
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
0x3C59344F
hardly sew."
0xAB68444F

0xDB06C2B2
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
0x49D336ED
caught the drift of the dialogue.
0x0F88F5CF

0xDB06C2B2
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.
0xFBB131A0
Rochester.
0xF9FB9926

0xDB06C2B2
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
0xAD41AAB2
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
0xC02193B6
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
0x47F18090
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go
0x0CBF0972
to bed."
0x8AE55766

0xDB06C2B2
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
0xB86BFF9E

0xDB06C2B2
"About ten."
0x1535CDAA

0xDB06C2B2
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
0x89C30E4D

0xDB06C2B2
I assented.
0xA341BFBE

0xDB06C2B2
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
0x61FE6006
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
0x6104EBC4
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
0x89C21C12
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
0x7D9B2179

0xDB06C2B2
"A little."
0xD249EBE6

0xDB06C2B2
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,
0x3ABCCCD6
if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
0x9C7659C4
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
0xEEEAC277
inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
0x55F31326
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
0xE3EA092B

0xDB06C2B2
I departed, obeying his directions.
0x8CAF846D

0xDB06C2B2
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
0xD362915E
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
0xAAFED87A
not well."
0x1C7BBA12

0xDB06C2B2
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
0x84CDBDF1
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
0x4C5BF01F
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
0xA36CD930

0xDB06C2B2
"No, indeed!" I interjected.
0x3542C5DB

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
0xDD523724
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
0x0C634E2C
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
0x66497165

0xDB06C2B2
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."
0xE7DC76EF

0xDB06C2B2
I brought the portfolio from the library.
0x5B8D38ED

0xDB06C2B2
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
0x9027906F
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
0xDE37C58A

0xDB06C2B2
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
0x67880350
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
0x52F71A21

0xDB06C2B2
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
0x44681C0E
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
0x1FF21672

0xDB06C2B2
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
0x78F25A73
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
0x88B6D9E4
questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
0xF7FBDEA1
hand yours?"
0x5F775F99

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
0x36D48AFA
some thought."
0xF9838341

0xDB06C2B2
"I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
0xC69895AC
other occupation."
0xF941C533

0xDB06C2B2
"Where did you get your copies?"
0x65792069

0xDB06C2B2
"Out of my head."
0x3977A52D

0xDB06C2B2
"That head I see now on your shoulders?"
0x61340A26

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"
0x77B06395

"I should think it may have: I should hope--better."
0x6C4C1BF7

0xDB06C2B2
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
0x79EA3EDC

0xDB06C2B2
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
0xCA8119F5
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
0x22A87C67
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
0xADD5FC7E
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
0x19EE6F4A
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
0xE75160CB
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
0x99939057

0xDB06C2B2
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
0xA03EDE3C
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
0x52FF6879
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
0x69DD5683
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
0xAB380690
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
0x56A12C69
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
0xA08B5DE7
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
0x12B7E44A
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
0x7143C4AC
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
0xDFEF1481
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
0xEEA6ACD3

0xDB06C2B2
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
0x80189FEA
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
0x387A32CD
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
0x0D652DF8
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
0xC690160E
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
0xC3D78B3B
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
0xEFBA2C8B
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
0xA882B92F
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
0x74AACB9B
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
0x9D4AD91F
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
0xB670DF4B

0xDB06C2B2
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
0x94741ED5
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
0x3F9EADC5
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
0x237ACC88
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
0x23BAF794
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
0x16E654F8
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
0xEA0A58E2
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
0xA793775E
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
0x4A3733F0
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
0xD6453411
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
0x790E60A3
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
0x0E0561F8
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
0x48DE5B35

0xDB06C2B2
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
0x0CFFDD3B
presently.
0xA43CA9E5

0xDB06C2B2
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
0xD7C3EE3F
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
0x7E26A2A3

0xDB06C2B2
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
0x4A924E79
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
0xEC2FC9F3
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
0x4D415895
each day?"
0x5441F79F

0xDB06C2B2
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
0xA9381C43
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
0x3A572F92
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
0xBD121296

0xDB06C2B2
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
0x9E632F98

0xDB06C2B2
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
0x49327DBE
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
0xD295DDB8
powerless to realise."
0x32521DAA

0xDB06C2B2
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
0xC57C32D5
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
0xE44625B4
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
0xB435732E
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
0x29D39AF7
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
0x0CCA1650
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
0x1F0A0572
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
0xB07C06CE
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
0x84C939A4
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
0x993894F4

0xDB06C2B2
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
0x341C5FCE
watch, he said abruptly--
0x2CF78771

0xDB06C2B2
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
0x05B89C0D
so long?  Take her to bed."
0xDF1D0B43

0xDB06C2B2
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
0x84B7859D
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
0x6C3E50C6
much.
0xA1AAE003

0xDB06C2B2
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
0x0F4F5779
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
0xA07E764C
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
0x88308896
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
0x98F8576E

0xDB06C2B2
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
0x88707F64
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
0xCFA52E52

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, is he?"
0xC6B5411C

0xDB06C2B2
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
0x6B2ECE40

0xDB06C2B2
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
0x64BD6CA2
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
0x26A0A48F
temper, allowance should be made."
0x5E42ABF4

0xDB06C2B2
"Why?"
0x899CA234

0xDB06C2B2
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
0x285B164F
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
0x978E058D
make his spirits unequal."
0x44088C9D

0xDB06C2B2
"What about?"
0x884A1B03

0xDB06C2B2
"Family troubles, for one thing."
0xCE475F0E

0xDB06C2B2
"But he has no family."
0x166202E3

0xDB06C2B2
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
0x28350CDB
brother a few years since."
0x3E7DD117

0xDB06C2B2
"His _elder_ brother?"
0xB2B6A4DA

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
0x29DACB43
the property; only about nine years."
0xC3493F75

0xDB06C2B2
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
0xCABE8288
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
0xD2EBD6BB

0xDB06C2B2
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
0xBE594B91
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
0xAAAFCA49
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
0x08D0B7F1
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
0xA1C0723A
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
0x3AF31ABD
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
0xE922BF61
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
0x1036FE4A
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
0x99FF43A2
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
0xD3868BED
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
0x5FF6A10B
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
0xB13B376E
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
0xBCB1A34E
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
0x4B3FAFB2
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
0x79D82184
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
0xD86BB8EE
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
0x873CC0D3

0xDB06C2B2
"Why should he shun it?"
0x7709DD2A

0xDB06C2B2
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
0xCD1DF90D

0xDB06C2B2
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
0x6E5BF767
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
0xB95DD967
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
0x87EADBDE
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
0xB5EEE086
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
0xAB94B0CF
subject, which I did accordingly.
0x4D070835

CHAPTER XIV
0xD2D7CB78

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
0x211BBB7D
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
0x1F99BE3B
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
0xC40F6A63
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
0xDEE0BD5F
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
0x689BE162
generally did not come back till late at night.
0x1AF56EE3

0xDB06C2B2
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
0x5D8CC9A5
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
0xA3E1A3C7
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
0x6D9A54C1
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
0x3A3195DC
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
0xAC827BDB
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
0xD1F65594
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
0x1C441E98
causes quite disconnected with me.
0x717C4744

0xDB06C2B2
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
0x74434599
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
0xEBC28051
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
0xBBDE274D
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
0x1AF5CCD9
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
0xEE15DB9C
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
0xEB3E3313
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
0xF935545B
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
0xE64FF20D
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
0xED5D7702
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
0xA5C013B0
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
0x59792695
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
0x222E4AE7
She appeared to know it by instinct.
0xE42183FA

0xDB06C2B2
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
0x03C23A37

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
0xCB4CCC23
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
0x9135EA88
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
0xDF9F8D84
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
0xCC54E647
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
0x44705390
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
0x82DC298A
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
0x39D74DA7

0xDB06C2B2
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
0x656F9055
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
0x232E1399
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
0x325FCA87
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
0xA998F2AC

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
0x0720C7C2
contemplation.
0x4A5090BF

0xDB06C2B2
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
0xCC2C8933
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
0x7A49E340

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
0x31329455
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
0x4FADA3EA
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
0x3F8674D6
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
0x4B21E3C5
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
0x7D8A4FF8
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
0x07FA23C2
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
0xFEFA5802
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
0x7C7EF33B
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
0x9BD15C78
said to be thicker than water."
0x3B5B2FC3

0xDB06C2B2
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
0x5A53C46C
knitting-basket in hand.
0x9B501FAF

0xDB06C2B2
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
0x60083F44
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
0x97E28BDF
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
0xBE3B8607
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
0x48C6034A
performed."
0xF83C9F5E

0xDB06C2B2
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
0x982A7739
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
0x16BC6E3A
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
0x45A685CE
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
0x925044BB

0xDB06C2B2
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
0xC7CDD6E6
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
0x09A1F148
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
0x912F74DA
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
0x1A14B333
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
0x6B3BF164
mind to do."
0x486BFC5E

0xDB06C2B2
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
0xF6A52226
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
0xF0CD1D74
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
0x976BC60E

0xDB06C2B2
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
0xE61E147A
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
0x8F7A5A42
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
0x09C15FAF
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
0xD3A320F2
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
0xAA1E808A
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
0xE4E057BE

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
0xF6B7ECE5
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
0x911031A4
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
0x06804BF6
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
0xD1F59BEE
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
0x7463AA5A
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
0x90CA2FA6
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
0xC800AEAD
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
0x78E1732D
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
0xF4D92D23
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
0xDCDCC26A
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
0x0255922E
feeling.
0xF7EDAE96

0xDB06C2B2
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
0xEEC46642
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
0xA8D22C1A
fastened on his physiognomy.
0xBF96C3AC

0xDB06C2B2
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
0xFB6B52E7

0xDB06C2B2
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
0x9F798E5B
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
0x919CE100
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
0x12BFE121

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
0x19508A98
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
0x0933A71D
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
0xE51DA116
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
0xF3A9F083
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
0xBCD84660
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
0x2FE72AF6
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
0xE394DC78

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
0x8D2F83FB
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
0xAF8BC520
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
0x90FEAE67
consequence, or something of that sort."
0xCA694F6F

0xDB06C2B2
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
0x5CC0D061
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
0x9F08C932
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
0x205FFB9F
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
0x6C965E85
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
0xA2CD879E

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
0xC36DF88C
repartee: it was only a blunder."
0x69492241

0xDB06C2B2
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
0xA08566E9
does my forehead not please you?"
0x2321454E

0xDB06C2B2
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
0xFA2581C4
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
0xB064F91B
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
0xDC5892D3

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
0x769E4034

0xDB06C2B2
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
0x13DFE53C
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
0x4BBC744E

0xDB06C2B2
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
0x5910CCB8
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
0xC7FC8FC7
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
0x79D1475A
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
0x9C51A84E
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
0xA988F675
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
0xFA09E217
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
0x15A29399
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
0xB8805207
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
0x66007932
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
0x684D5E4A
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
0x5B2D0874
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
0x045B46DB
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
0x6729717C
me?"
0x2EFFBAE5

0xDB06C2B2
"Hope of what, sir?"
0xE1AF502D

0xDB06C2B2
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
0xE93E6FDB

0xDB06C2B2
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
0x0E395328
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
0x9990CA84
capable of being re-transformed?
0x1D51340E

0xDB06C2B2
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
0x8476D9B0
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
0x9A6BD281
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
0xB5E5C2CB
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
0xF9C2F906
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
0xF3EFA083
to-night."
0x7EFDE99A

0xDB06C2B2
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
0x320D4BFD
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
0x6ADDD674
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
0x155AC7CD
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
0x447625B5
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
0x2148A3AB
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
0x2F3E201F
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
0x1FAC012D
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
0x210B6B18
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
0x66526504
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
0xE79F22AF
confidence.
0x2C98D37A

0xDB06C2B2
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
0x049AEC44
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
0x7D58AABF
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
0xA908BF57
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
0xD66719F5
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
0x6E6E8EEF
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
0x80080532
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
0x0127AD5B
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
0x0F095B66
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
0x52AF8191
you--therefore speak."
0xB4EE19E3

0xDB06C2B2
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
0xBE411FCA
smile either.
0xC9E1A531

0xDB06C2B2
"Speak," he urged.
0x2AFC08BF

0xDB06C2B2
"What about, sir?"
0x918D8E46

0xDB06C2B2
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
0x89336581
treating it entirely to yourself."
0x9BDB57D8

0xDB06C2B2
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
0xC894ACC1
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
0x3C455605
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
0xE7506B11

0xDB06C2B2
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
0xB61822BE

0xDB06C2B2
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
0xF9F41B34
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
0xC2A8CFA8

0xDB06C2B2
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
0xA6FBCE82
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
0x5C58018C
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
0x2BFF7519
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
0xDA15EB02
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
0x3A4DC1F2
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
0x942FDA88
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
0x73DCB567
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
0x5A5E1B1C
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
0x2C0F2287
rusty nail."
0x0CC45664

0xDB06C2B2
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
0xE3D17BCD
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
0xDF37B5D8

0xDB06C2B2
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
0x8633D8E5
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
0x68216DF3
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
0x3D837662

0xDB06C2B2
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
0x02660F27
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
0xC468033B
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
0x03300AEB
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
0x041C157D
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
0xAB89D84D
people in one house?"
0x0D609B05

0xDB06C2B2
"Do as you please, sir."
0x722400F3

0xDB06C2B2
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
0x217B3059
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
0x29E73710

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
0x92336BCD
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
0x29D507C9
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
0x990680FD
and experience."
0xD20E7308

0xDB06C2B2
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
0x0CEFA335
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
0x6F73AA14
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
0x9FF6F41A
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
0x6A4E99F6
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
0x0F4CF11A

0xDB06C2B2
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
0xA05CAAF4
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
0xFB9D0678

0xDB06C2B2
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
0x4173D419
expression; "but speak too."
0x31CD6BD7

0xDB06C2B2
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
0x2B57DD9E
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
0xCA364C7A
their orders."
0x80021EA0

0xDB06C2B2
"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
0x5B48912A
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
0x824A021A
you agree to let me hector a little?"
0x344E552D

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
0x0B24A1F6
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
0xC996F6FB
dependency, I agree heartily."
0x119861FA

0xDB06C2B2
"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
0x83EA735A
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"
0x04244F1B

0xDB06C2B2
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
0xFC58C027
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
0x44EDCD6E
salary."
0xAA757A01

0xDB06C2B2
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
0x3D662AFC
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
0x34B8282D
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
0x1736AB97
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
0x050204B4
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
0x57BFC57C
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
0xED1F3721
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
0x23792DCA
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
0xAD7C3EDB
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
0x1066CBB4
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
0xAF3E0883
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
0x32A537A0
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
0x1EDFC8C8
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
0x26C75045
defects to counterbalance your few good points."
0x8EAF9FE5

0xDB06C2B2
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
0x013A7AA9
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
0xE0ECDDFC
as well as imagined--
0xB2D0D79A

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
0x8DD27CB5
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
0x5AF58FDC
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
0xEDCF3D5E
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
0x2DDBC314
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
0x1B88194F
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
0x3669CD98
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
0xC043E536
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
0x1AEBEBE1
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
0x03C9A9C7
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
0x5003C4FC
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
0x7ADE0EB9
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
0x4F599A6F
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
0x1A7B07F4

0xDB06C2B2
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
0x2DBE7F39

0xDB06C2B2
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
0xA6B1567A
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
0x0997F4D2
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
0x9E73B3A4
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
0x2BB1506F
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
0x959284D3
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
0xE41AFBF2
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
0x23733A1D
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
0x38A04E25
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
0x58CAE90E
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
0x08A55E2A
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
0x426F5012
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
0xA516AF53
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
0x7FAA3209
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
0xB2FE229A
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
0xF4C9A499
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
0x733E505C
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
0x6BFB828A
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."
0x62443F96

0xDB06C2B2
"How do you know?--how can you guess all this, sir?"
0xB6FFDF47

0xDB06C2B2
"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
0x2F813679
writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been
0x9413F72E
superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
0x1EC50A76
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
0xCD88B87D
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites
0xF5B21C3E
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
0x9754829A
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I
0x33F6DE87
wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are
0x82066FBA
tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life."
0x5F5D015E

0xDB06C2B2
"Repentance is said to be its cure, sir."
0xF2E86289

0xDB06C2B2
"It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I
0xE0237BD0
have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,
0xD3C9EB46
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is
0x62B3136D
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I
0x37CD4838
_will_ get it, cost what it may."
0x356A41E7

0xDB06C2B2
"Then you will degenerate still more, sir."
0x9BC8167B

0xDB06C2B2
"Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I
0xE4B98760
may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
0x96611644
moor."
0x2489F5C7

0xDB06C2B2
"It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir."
0xCC8D2471

0xDB06C2B2
"How do you know?--you never tried it.  How very serious--how very solemn
0x45117B75
you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head"
0x1BAEE9E5
(taking one from the mantelpiece).  "You have no right to preach to me,
0x032FCF99
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely
0x23E8E773
unacquainted with its mysteries."
0xF652D768

0xDB06C2B2
"I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
0x00251312
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence."
0xD49DDF12

0xDB06C2B2
"And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered
0xACDCD85A
across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather
0x9BFD069B
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here
0x6A7569DA
it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on
0x0BE3CCFF
the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest
0x63FF1291
when it asks entrance to my heart."
0x8920A8EE

0xDB06C2B2
"Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel."
0xDC5F5E7F

0xDB06C2B2
"Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to
0xE84344AB
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the
0x92F0ABC5
eternal throne--between a guide and a seducer?"
0x73E8D4F4

0xDB06C2B2
"I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the
0x252CF744
suggestion had returned upon you.  I feel sure it will work you more
0x50EB149D
misery if you listen to it."
0x0BBFA4AB

0xDB06C2B2
"Not at all--it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
0x134E645C
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy.
0xE2450119
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!"
0x38C61665

0xDB06C2B2
He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own;
0x14D0DC28
then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he
0x2027C7A2
seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.
0x18BC4988

0xDB06C2B2
"Now," he continued, again addressing me, "I have received the pilgrim--a
0x6F5E829A
disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my
0x23915F91
heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine."
0x99DBDA90

0xDB06C2B2
"To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the
0x83302FAA
conversation, because it has got out of my depth.  Only one thing, I
0x9DBA4B3B
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
0x75402688
you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you
0xEC5BD4DB
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems
0x1F630965
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
0x62BBD5A2
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
0xF33BB4DB
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in
0x54EE03D9
a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to
0x8AD59E92
which you might revert with pleasure."
0xA62CDD4C

0xDB06C2B2
"Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
0x6D378BDC
paving hell with energy."
0x71A1B88C

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir?"
0xF152E326

0xDB06C2B2
"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
0xBDC5BB50
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
0x10A5416B
been."
0xD46B30C4

0xDB06C2B2
"And better?"
0x912B3A86

0xDB06C2B2
"And better--so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.  You seem to
0x43EA9CCA
doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
0x106C2F7C
are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
0x8A7C2F47
and Persians, that both are right."
0x777A5278

0xDB06C2B2
"They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them."
0x699EB0BC

0xDB06C2B2
"They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
0xE3B7C870
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules."
0xFEDEB68E

0xDB06C2B2
"That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it
0x1827FB58
is liable to abuse."
0x0FF3A997

0xDB06C2B2
"Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
0xBFF36AB5
abuse it."
0x284814D6

0xDB06C2B2
"You are human and fallible."
0x5B58ED20

0xDB06C2B2
"I am: so are you--what then?"
0x07D4689A

0xDB06C2B2
"The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine
0x1532AEF0
and perfect alone can be safely intrusted."
0xACA9AC49

0xDB06C2B2
"What power?"
0x119F4D80

0xDB06C2B2
"That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,--'Let it be
0x7E22DA1E
right.'"
0xDC25C51B

0xDB06C2B2
"'Let it be right'--the very words: you have pronounced them."
0xDEA2003F

0xDB06C2B2
"_May_ it be right then," I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
0xFF7B1F4C
continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible
0x9F37AF12
that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at
0xD93DAA34
least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague
0xEDEA80EC
sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.
0xEA6496DB

0xDB06C2B2
"Where are you going?"
0x641AA2AF

0xDB06C2B2
"To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime."
0xA711F23E

0xDB06C2B2
"You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx."
0x6024A146

0xDB06C2B2
"Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
0x5CCB7356
certainly not afraid."
0x615540E1

0xDB06C2B2
"You _are_ afraid--your self-love dreads a blunder."
0x117F9EA4

0xDB06C2B2
"In that sense I do feel apprehensive--I have no wish to talk nonsense."
0xF67CA1F6

0xDB06C2B2
"If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake
0x5089241B
it for sense.  Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?  Don't trouble yourself to
0x01E09D0D
answer--I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe
0x6891270B
me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.
0xF3646CA5
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your
0x8B54B725
features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear
0x21C60DE7
in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you
0x47BB666A
will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in
0x20E4BEBE
time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it
0x2CB7F1E9
impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements
0x0B330777
will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.  I see at
0xB516284D
intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars
0x222180E7
of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but
0x404EA8E4
free, it would soar cloud-high.  You are still bent on going?"
0xDD6D02F7

0xDB06C2B2
"It has struck nine, sir."
0x0E3127DA

0xDB06C2B2
"Never mind,--wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.  My
0x74CCF187
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
0xB993B520
favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally
0x40F4303D
watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
0x14CA228F
study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).
0x41564342
She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
0xB3F507EB
frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
0x2270C5C8
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il
0xECF13D76
faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed
0x609997C9
out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in
0x49DD5D6D
a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a
0xC1CB109D
miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
0xEEBE84F7
rising of--But never mind that.  However, my tenderest feelings are about
0xB8BBD02C
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it
0x1F0E3625
will be realised."
0x78D109C2

0xDB06C2B2
Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She
0x21416E4C
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of
0x377C755B
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
0xF918170F
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
0x9F868AED
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
0xA851E5FA
and small white satin sandals.
0x2329A636

0xDB06C2B2
"Est-ce que ma robe va bien?" cried she, bounding forwards; "et mes
0xEBDB46C1
souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"
0x50282C21

0xDB06C2B2
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having
0xD7E52EBD
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
0xF5943FBB
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
0x299571F8

0xDB06C2B2
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she
0x3EE6376C
added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"
0x381D23EF

0xDB06C2B2
"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English
0x9DC88457
gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss
0x2846AAC6
Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
0x2735EAE7
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
0x25A72C3E
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not
0xE17F80C4
valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
0x50760DBC
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the
0x7AE5ABD4
blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
0x3C180442
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
0xD3BD024F
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.
0x486D5553
Good-night."

CHAPTER XV
0xFD39BE23

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
0x51EEEFFA
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while
0x028E74B6
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
0x90C2A0F0
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
0x0C1CAEBF

0xDB06C2B2
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
0x10B6937C
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
0x21B0B6BE
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
0xC5B62A25
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
0x54B23E6D
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
0x49814046
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
0x14401A2A

0xDB06C2B2
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
0x1EDB98A6
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
0x42C4A634
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
0xFE8A0908
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
0x645768CF
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
0x84ABCCC8
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
0x64E807A3
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
0xD628A0DE
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
0xEB31D15C
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
0xA86963C0
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
0xA52EE0D5
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
0x3CD80DBD
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
0x4F3C7233
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
0x804035E2
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
0x6D6D3BEF
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
0x59908A6A
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
0x39A83A6A
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
0x0A0FA48B
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
0xCA13EA0A
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
0x89B8992B
now, if you will excuse me."
0xB4241121

0xDB06C2B2
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
0x0370DA4C
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
0xD2A4D6B5
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
0x04F2A4FC

0xDB06C2B2
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
0xBF538824
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
0x1DC55B3A
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
0xBB4383E1
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
0x626ECD8D
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
0x49707CA8
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
0x6FC66750
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
0xCA3FDFC0
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
0x2EE14703
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
0xFD02CB3A
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
0x88117CE7
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
0xFE021484
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
0x661F49FC
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
0x7310A33A
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
0x646CC957
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
0xF28062DC
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
0x51F94180
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
0x23A09C8F
cochere_ of the hotel.
0xDB288227

0xDB06C2B2
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
0x68EE8726
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
0xBB36AD26
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
0xFA824E76
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
0x7CAF5513
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
0xB92B5E0A
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
0x35C183D0
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
0x586C6B3D
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
0x3FACDCA4
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
0x3B6CE8EF
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
0x3B77A7D6
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
0x8E005E4E
current--as I am now.
0x21440F76

0xDB06C2B2
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
0x4E52C712
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
0xA1DDA2C2
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
0xAFB0EEF3
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
0x6B432EF7
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
0xFE3FFC88
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
0x9B45B53E

0xDB06C2B2
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
0x05B6EEA8
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
0xA4C9116C
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
0x561E581C

0xDB06C2B2
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
0xB5A0681C
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
0x93F195FC
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
0x41BCAD97
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
0x27A6514C
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
0xFC9C929E
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
0xDBCA2C71
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
0xCD6D4CBA
his countenance: he went on--
0xF9F6F0D9

0xDB06C2B2
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
0x97B47E92
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
0xCF70B444
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
0xFC7461F0
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
0x1AFA910C
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
0x998EF1F7
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
0x94802CD0
if you dare!'
0x5A5CAAC8

0xDB06C2B2
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
0xC5954741
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
0x3163D6E4
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
0x0E61F205
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
0x67AC2AFB
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
0x3541E3D9
but straw and rotten wood."
0x476B13A3

0xDB06C2B2
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
0x8F4CEB8C
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
0xAF4525B6
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
0x7639441C
whence he had abruptly diverged--
0xBB5D8BF3

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
0xE7CCE31D

0xDB06C2B2
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
0x10FEFF89
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
0x8922DC8C
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
0xCA61E183
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
0xE6A8AE5E
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
0x5B0BC64F
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
0x7BD96547
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
0x7E3EEF80
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
0x6B4FBB6D
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
0x4F45F4DD
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
0x91AB338B
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
0xE5EBA1D4
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
0x10C87340
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
0x39F9D611
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
0xDD885703
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
0x8AE51F11
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
0x81BF62E8
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
0xDFD19A54
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
0x8059A64C
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
0xB00A527D
After this digression he proceeded--
0xF941CD36

0xDB06C2B2
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
0xEE923EAC
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
0x25B535F8
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
0x87F574FE
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
0x07976485
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
0xE99388F6
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
0x137ED65E
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
0xFB4252A7
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
0x77421145
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
0xDFB713C7
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
0x047BB9F4
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
0x86ED1213
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
0xF3E80CA6
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
0x109C3DB7
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
0xB6674D20
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
0x24E70E71
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
0x4453692D
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
0xAC856B92
who had been her dupe.
0xE761DE5D

0xDB06C2B2
"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
0xDA244C08
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
0x158EB2B3
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
0x4C0BEA5D
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
0x479D2EB9
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
0x705DB621
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
0xAE174E13
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
0x0E12DCCC
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
0x442EA439
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
0x526484D2
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
0xA8C1BDDA
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"
0xACEA806C

0xDB06C2B2
Adele here came running up again.
0x709BC78F

0xDB06C2B2
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
0x4D17E42F
wishes to see you."
0xB83BAFAE

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
0x6140024F
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
0x603EB1B5
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
0xE0D6F5F5
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
0x602E05EE
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
0x85F3A194
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
0x9835A4DF
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
0xA464FA95
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
0x7E4D23E9
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
0x51D56FCD
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
0xB3864013
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
0x411A42DD
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
0xE2F7357B
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
0xB0F9559F
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
0x44726647
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
0x08382D87
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
0xC2658880
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
0x01E66B18
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
0xB44A5723
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
0xD69E65AC
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
0x79E3376F
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
0xDE4DCDE6
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
0xB87CC5C7

0xDB06C2B2
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
0x573E33C1
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
0xD197A5DB
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
0x14117CC7
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
0xAC90EFED
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
0x8EA72DE8
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
0xB1AFC3CE

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
0x0078340C
you too: it darkens."
0x5E2C36D6

0xDB06C2B2
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
0xB30DCAE6
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
0x125D38A8
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
0xD0DA860D
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
0x2648DACA
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
0x2F348A1D
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
0x2AC6D0DF
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
0xEBA47EEB
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
0x00FC2AF4
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
0x85B52DE0
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
0x017CD21C
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
0x929D49F3
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
0xD8E5FB26

0xDB06C2B2
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
0x75269598
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
0xB06CC7AA
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
0x381BCE05
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
0xF3F9D129
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
0xA6CF2BC7
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
0x8600B975
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
0x5531B1F5
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
0xE23AB825
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
0x43079CC9
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
0xC889E8D0
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
0x9901AACC
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
0x00238B3E
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
0xBC3C9E4C
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
0x6834C24F
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
0x67D6E936
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
0x0A5D3D33
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
0x3C3F78DE
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
0x70F0E70C
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
0x3961AEEE
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
0xAC3DABF2
benefit.
0xACA4E442

0xDB06C2B2
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
0x0C0BA617
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
0xBD77170B
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
0x9E388F49
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
0x448F6D18
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
0x8D478DFB
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
0x59A63CD8
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
0xEE8CA899
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
0x50025239
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
0x755D406C

0xDB06C2B2
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
0x2F45E999
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
0x0859AE72
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
0xB74CB1EF
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
0xE4CEB74E
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
0x02371B64
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
0x3EC17EB8
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
0xFECE862A
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
0x89B18C27

0xDB06C2B2
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
0x1241B3E5
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
0xCD51AC87
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
0xE517E83B
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
0x92260E7A
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
0x4C66EBCF
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
0x010CC8F8
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
0x24AB31AA
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
0x15E8AEA3
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
0x304818A1
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
0x385C8D40
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
0xF6851E94
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
0x8661853E
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
0xB7E240D6
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
0xD394B591
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
0x5A176C43
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
0xB61BC558
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
0xD713F73D
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
0x5EB76283
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
0x35DFB8B4

0xDB06C2B2
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
0x3C2E21DC
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
0xB02A01DB
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
0xD287A4F3
Thornfield.
0x38A43756

0xDB06C2B2
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
0x7DF754C8
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
0x8AE5E5E0
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
0x1DA05060
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
0x3EADCA80
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
0xD755968D

0xDB06C2B2
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
0xF42F12F5
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
0x95343165
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
0xAACA7D57
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
0x460708E0
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
0x560CC7A8

0xDB06C2B2
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
0x881B08C7
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
0x4E51CF3A
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
0x3323BC8B
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
0x52C2DCCE
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
0xB9E38C0A

0xDB06C2B2
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
0xD5CAC40A
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
0x9567D536
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
0x10594350
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
0xEA6D2705
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
0x75393D94
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
0x9BC47C44
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
0xB5CE0563
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
0xB939CD77
enough.
0x553A4B6A

0xDB06C2B2
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
0x3B158576
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
0x8C6629E4
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
0x16214959
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
0x0D315970
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
0xFAEB5617
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
0xF6AF1C7D
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
0xEB4A62EA
there?"
0xB6B8EC34

0xDB06C2B2
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
0x9F88191E
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
0x3AD97B9E
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
0xCBC9C8E0

0xDB06C2B2
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
0x1721791D
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
0x3DFBE860
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
0x11B82FFF
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
0xF330655F
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
0x00666E63
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
0x7124D140
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
0xDD1BDA5F
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
0x5F5BD64C
burning.
0xD3D6DFBF

0xDB06C2B2
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
0x1FFB8036
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
0x96519057
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
0xF44C0901
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
0x33858B7C
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
0x39858E86
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
0x70951EDE

0xDB06C2B2
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
0x24144D96
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
0x0B4D6E74
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
0xC086682C
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
0x31A01FAE
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
0x583F985C
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
0xD0095772
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
0xA19C14C5

0xDB06C2B2
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
0xDDB2A3CE
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
0xDFD0469C
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
0x8382DD0D
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
0xAE525713
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
0xF077297C
water.
0xDCA0A0AA

0xDB06C2B2
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
0x8BE86E24

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
0xCD34CE07
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
0xEC8F63B2

0xDB06C2B2
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
0x944AA7D0
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
0x4B6BC9A1
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
0x7BBBB5E8

0xDB06C2B2
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
0x3C58F40B
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
0xC024D713

0xDB06C2B2
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
0x4A18787D
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
0x2B514D3C
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
0xCD0398C9

0xDB06C2B2
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
0x3646B1C3
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
0x3157104B
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
0xA6DDC246

0xDB06C2B2
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
0xC135B14C
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
0xECB762E1
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
0xCE9BDDA6
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
0xDE630F18
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
0xB5BAD1D5

0xDB06C2B2
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
0xEA5219EA

0xDB06C2B2
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
0x459DF3FA
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
0xFC1F9BB4

0xDB06C2B2
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
0xEB891A1D

0xDB06C2B2
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
0x1A25B71B
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
0x34759DA2

0xDB06C2B2
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
0xA6422681

0xDB06C2B2
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
0x4EC144DC
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
0x06CC2CD0
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
0xC082E4C4
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
0x6C88C29E
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
0xA00F551D
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
0x35EBE739
move, remember, or call any one."
0x9E825DEF

0xDB06C2B2
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
0xA94E5EE2
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
0xCED3D3D2
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
0x30C86C1A
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
0x81193DE7
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
0x302637BC
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
0xAECF3433
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
0x0E8546D7
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
0x83D35762
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
0xD0E58CC2
"and not something worse."
0x2D4F1DED

0xDB06C2B2
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
0xB467EDDF
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
0xBC0AF892

0xDB06C2B2
"How, sir?"
0xEF146AB4

0xDB06C2B2
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
0xC600E92E
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
0xC55FAC36

0xDB06C2B2
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
0xE0A77983
door."
0xE032A6AD

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
0xA299B63D

0xDB06C2B2
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
0x3E9BF616
think, or something like it?"
0xE7174413

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
0x24CC594A
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
0x305EFD14

0xDB06C2B2
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
0xD9105D0B
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
0xEEE31564
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
0xCC688C00
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
0x3E49A3D5
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
0x9C8A9A6C
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
0x9FF26706
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
0xEB1BDEC3
hours the servants will be up."
0x9D29BE6D

0xDB06C2B2
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
0x86FFFC61

0xDB06C2B2
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
0x67D1D8D4
go.
0xC0D666FD

0xDB06C2B2
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
0xC8CD4C5E

0xDB06C2B2
"You said I might go, sir."
0x23107314

0xDB06C2B2
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
0x3ADC6F40
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
0x83AB6291
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
0xB3B9BB79
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
0xE7F16530
At least shake hands."
0x942CB141

0xDB06C2B2
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
0xE6B963CE
both his own.
0xBC0E971A

0xDB06C2B2
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
0xC6A6D064
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
0x2ABDD4F2
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
0x653D40E7
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
0x345833B1

0xDB06C2B2
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
0x5188318B
his voice was checked.
0x9D90EBD5

0xDB06C2B2
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
0xA351C1BD
in the case."
0xBB3032A8

0xDB06C2B2
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
0xED79C621
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
0xD2F5B363
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
0xB1ADD97F
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
0xAAB614FE
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
0x2C8BFED7
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
0x7091F325

0xDB06C2B2
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
0xC45BF1D1

0xDB06C2B2
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
0x4B0B92A7

0xDB06C2B2
"What! you _will_ go?"
0x46D4968C

0xDB06C2B2
"I am cold, sir."
0xEC14D826

0xDB06C2B2
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
0xCA562114
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
0x94339E1E
expedient.
0x0667330E

0xDB06C2B2
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
0x3F4C0F91

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
0x5B119C40

0xDB06C2B2
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
0x194C19F6
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
0xEC749CBE
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
0xC826C94C
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
0xA970D17F
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
0xFC20C50F
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
0x56C21687
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
0x41021495
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.

CHAPTER XVI
0x6DF8CCB1

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
0xD4AFFAC0
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
0xCF297802
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
0xDA1146B9
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
0x3B05C470
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
0xB5FF848E
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
0x92588E4E

0xDB06C2B2
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
0x62530FEF
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
0xDC0D7D30
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
0x1B25B4EA
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
0x0A2C7AA4
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
0x3C5A5E57
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
0x876A3FDD
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
0xDEAFBEA4
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
0xAD790DB5
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
0x29988046

0xDB06C2B2
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
0x7E82E560
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
0x58B5D994
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
0x470172BC
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
0xDD0014CC
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
0xA60738DD
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
0x77981D06
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
0xDABF4914
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
0x72CF7D4B
no other than Grace Poole.
0x88E4ECAE

0xDB06C2B2
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
0x7E41C5CB
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
0x48A6B35F
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
0x706EB211
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
0xDE8D7A42
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
0x41418DC5
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
0x0081A406
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
0x1AE3E9EA
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
0x1144C0A4
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
0xA674620E
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
0x7B6F1227
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
0xFAD0F47A
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
0x1B3BF798
went on with her sewing.
0x722947E6

0xDB06C2B2
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
0xE198476A
is past comprehension."
0x13A7070C

0xDB06C2B2
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
0x67E066BD
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
0x933774E0

0xDB06C2B2
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
0x59D5D793
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
0xD591353A
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
0x7350BBA5
the flames with the water in the ewer."
0x01C85C79

0xDB06C2B2
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
0x0C7706DC
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
0x675D0662

0xDB06C2B2
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
0xACE8CD81
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
0x72271345
she answered--
0x2D15D61A

0xDB06C2B2
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
0xF5DBCA7D
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
0x73DA681F
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
0xC4D34DE4
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
0x9425360F
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
0x3D8D7849
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
0x2DBBB300
a noise?"
0x07F00317

0xDB06C2B2
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
0xFB51FD07
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
0x8D0CA1A2
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
0xC97D4C1A

0xDB06C2B2
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
0x46561AAE
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
0xA2F5D253

0xDB06C2B2
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
0x1BD9E352
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
0x137E3D04

0xDB06C2B2
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
0xB7299FF6
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
0x9D85B723
conscious eye.
0xAE56366D

0xDB06C2B2
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
0xF5B282F5

0xDB06C2B2
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
0xF633F2D2

0xDB06C2B2
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
0x6452D182
gallery?" she further asked.
0x8C8DE24E

0xDB06C2B2
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
0x4F56A895
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
0xAEAD3CA1
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
0xA182A6B2
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
0x68555D41

0xDB06C2B2
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
0x96F09266

0xDB06C2B2
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
0xBE4AE216
you get into bed?"
0x934F582F

0xDB06C2B2
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
0xC64D2D78
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
0x609CC9B6
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
0xC4796FD5
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
0x9B314061
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
0x9918E9FA
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
0x132F2940
lie down."
0xB33B4E55

0xDB06C2B2
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
0x916E41B2
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
0xDB5F690B
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
0xD018DC37
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
0xE8B923BC
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
0x4E3FB42C
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
0x6F5F244C
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
0x01219F66
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
0xB4C9A094
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
0x8A73831B
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
0x657042ED
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
0xA853B1C5
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
0x3D4CE925
demureness of a Quakeress.
0x35867F02

0xDB06C2B2
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
0xDB7D916D
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
0x7C362042
entered.
0x2A0B51FC

0xDB06C2B2
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
0x6B51D594
be ready: will you come down?"
0x177CE240

0xDB06C2B2
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
0x7C85A3F1
carry it upstairs."
0x19B9C9BE

0xDB06C2B2
"You'll have some meat?"
0x74FA95F0

0xDB06C2B2
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
0x5E93E197

0xDB06C2B2
"And the sago?"
0x5D8B0395

0xDB06C2B2
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
0x85DEF561
make it myself."
0x3AA97396

0xDB06C2B2
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
0x4AC20A59
so I departed.
0x2976642A

0xDB06C2B2
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
0x6DD00D8E
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
0x02491CB4
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
0x3FF07E4B
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
0x261D51CC
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
0xA09DB853
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
0xC133C0C5
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
0xA27355D8
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
0x827C422A
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
0x1833FBA7
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
0xC8030F67
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
0xBE89C0AC
attempt, much less punish her for it.
0xD6508BCC

0xDB06C2B2
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
0x8A875FED
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
0x06833B05
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
0xEB314447
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
0x681A52EF
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
0x9C80506E
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
0x5B796A9A
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
0x0346B8CF
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
0x13731644
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
0x56BE1563
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
0x47453F05
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
0xF7EE5E68
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
0xFC3C68AE
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
0x72968C38
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
0x001663E3
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
0x8B27F405
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
0x05088167
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
0xF7D461CE
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
0x744ABF38
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
0x9E1FBE09
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
0x6640B66C

0xDB06C2B2
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
0xF71B116B
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
0xCE18A71B
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
0x94AA3B80

0xDB06C2B2
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
0xB8CCC4B6
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
0x1E18813C

0xDB06C2B2
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
0xFD8AA077
thinking.
0xFB0A1AFD

0xDB06C2B2
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
0x6FB4D01D
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
0xC7859162
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
0x5D20B38D
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
0xD1E50178
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
0xD703B3FE
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
0x06886B7B

0xDB06C2B2
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
0xE98C0AC8
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
0xA7A72552
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
0xF0A64512
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
0x8199DA03
impatient."
0x23E05C70

0xDB06C2B2
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
0x1AD4FD9B
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
0x03993EC2
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
0xF2250953
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
0xE86C4E11
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
0x54CBA86B
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
0xC2A84C7B
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
0x0B7A5022
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
0x016582D8
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
0x570CFCF1
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
0x230CF228
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
0x10D3A09B
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
0xF82426EE
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
0x7E3006DA
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
0x66220CBC
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
0x1C471DD5
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
0xDD211A49
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
0x83AB3D35
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
0xC0599600
restraint; this suited both him and me.
0x95B8ADC2

0xDB06C2B2
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
0xCAE994CE
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
0x3978E9E0
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
0x3DA96B5F
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
0xE5EB8F6F

0xDB06C2B2
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
0x05B6B218
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
0x30C1B7D9
day: you look flushed and feverish."
0x0672B0B1

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
0x621E6314

0xDB06C2B2
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
0xC7959C3C
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
0x2F63D059
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
0x81F82EEC
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
0x5BCE1D35
deepening into total obscurity.
0x159279EB

0xDB06C2B2
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
0x4F61588B
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
0x251D9FB8
his journey."
0xECF1DFA1

0xDB06C2B2
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
0x20911873

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
0x030C52DE
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
0x5CE40779
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
0xD5A3BF25
Colonel Dent, and others."
0x45B86AF3

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
0xD23AA91F

0xDB06C2B2
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
0xDDD7C96F
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
0xFCDA4EE1
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
0xCCD5FB5A
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
0xBF3AB015
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
0xDD697763
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
0x47F04427
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
0x1FD755B6
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
0x4F3C6209
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
0xD962DA80
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
0x907B0487

0xDB06C2B2
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"
0xEA90C802

0xDB06C2B2
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
0x74081BFB
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
0x73F6602F
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
0x971FA65B
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
0x982C13D2
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
0xCE212019
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
0xE54374E6
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
0x318CCB43
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
0xEB36D3DF
the evening."
0x06C96B48

0xDB06C2B2
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
0x356636AD

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
0x9FB64BA3
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
0xF417D437
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
0xA1062CB3
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
0x043457D4
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
0x908229D8
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
0x9D993A8E
was certainly the queen."
0x727DEAF5

0xDB06C2B2
"And what was she like?"
0x46902D2C

0xDB06C2B2
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
0x21C15649
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
0x68704832
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
0xFDB8C3DA
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
0x7ABEFDB5
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
0x00B0BD54
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
0xE7278FE6
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
0xF39CA1DA
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
0x5E139364
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
0xFB27E2EA
jetty mass of her curls."
0x5F07941D

0xDB06C2B2
"She was greatly admired, of course?"
0xB6D587FF

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
0x1504EB75
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
0x00587FEE
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
0x450D2A94

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing."
0xE0459D07

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."
0xC159CCBB

0xDB06C2B2
"And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"
0x55FA2321

0xDB06C2B2
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
0x6ED3BA21
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
0xDCF512F1
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."
0xFA9E41F5

0xDB06C2B2
"And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?"
0xA36A0FAA

0xDB06C2B2
"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
0x93314542
fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
0x54F38560
eldest son came in for everything almost."
0x7B1D178F

0xDB06C2B2
"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:
0x723922DD
Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?"
0xD00D6F33

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
0x1F5582A5
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
0xCBBE54CE

0xDB06C2B2
"What of that?  More unequal matches are made every day."
0xB39A184C

0xDB06C2B2
"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
0xFA888389
of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you
0x3236DF22
began tea."
0xE8A86F4F

0xDB06C2B2
"No: I am too thirsty to eat.  Will you let me have another cup?"
0x1F921513

0xDB06C2B2
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
0xC7872391
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the
0xE4AA8B15
conversation was turned into another channel.
0x6E2862BB

0xDB06C2B2
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
0x8797388F
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
0x3CDD3296
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
0xE01F176F
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
0x261B2DDC

0xDB06C2B2
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
0x226EBE2C
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
0x2EFB3914
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
0xE7A87928
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
0xE7294D39
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
0x237AACB1
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
0x0EB6C1A5

0xDB06C2B2
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
0x136F8675
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
0x483EFEA0
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
0xA73221BB

0xDB06C2B2
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
0xCF933034
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
0xD4B7B539
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
0x87DA489C
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
0x11AA8BD2
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
0x5BC3A3FB
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
0x9A8F5913
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
0xE1EF5F11
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
0x8BF51ADA
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
0xA823D9A3
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
0xFF922966
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
0xA09D4394
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
0x2552BDE3
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
0x3B8929DA
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
0x2FFF5980
is no extrication.
0xE0C34492

0xDB06C2B2
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
0x09B7BB02
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
0xF93291D6
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
0x8B816B0C
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
0x4FAA4135
poor, and plain.'
0x0E5F1F9E

0xDB06C2B2
"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
0xE8402889
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
0xFB1B391E
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
0xF7449CD6
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
0xEC2054C8
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
0x67758E6D
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
0x7DD40188
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
0xE1FC334A
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
0x189D15B3
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
0x4834C7D6
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
0x44222A0C
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
0x2A6A4C51
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
0xB44F4818
accomplished lady of rank.'
0xECC950EB

0xDB06C2B2
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
0x5FDBAFC8
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
0xA6393A56
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
0x186701C5
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
0xD289F08F
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
0x7348272D

0xDB06C2B2
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
0xE6FFEA10
calm, and fell asleep.
0x836CE09E

0xDB06C2B2
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
0xDC2DEBD7
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
0xA6271E70
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
0x7E341B9B
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
0x1719BBFD
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
0xFECEEC6F
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
0x5B4C512A
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
0x23148DEA

0xDB06C2B2
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
0x70B5F6F3
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
0x234928B7
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
0x9E24C675
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
0xBD7C9EF7
maintain, even externally.

CHAPTER XVII
0xBF3FEDEC

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
0xAA421BC3
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
0xE3A70626
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
0xD7AC1706
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
0x948C5E1D
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
0xCF7B73D2
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
0x85779C49
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
0x63BFF70A
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
0xA0F7D4A7
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
0xCDA03B69
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
0x824DB01B
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
0x6961BE4C
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
0xE0753A03
on the contrary, I just said--
0x39972D07

0xDB06C2B2
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
0x25DD53DA
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
0x19A0E968
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
0x5F7FB3E1
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
0x9694DB1A
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
0xCC8EB4E7
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
0xC6C9D43A
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
0x35E41728
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
0x6EABC331
wanted and would be despised."
0xB45DB9BF

0xDB06C2B2
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
0x3D1AC7F0
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
0x72E946C3
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
0x8DF5EBF6
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
0x1E049433
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
0x016ACEC4

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
0x10239A25
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
0x7E333565

0xDB06C2B2
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
0x68416FFB
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
0x03568A2F

0xDB06C2B2
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
0x36E39102
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
0x708AE7E0
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
0x8D7AB61A
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
0xF712A9D5
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
0x3960724E

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
0x0BCCF8BF
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
0x87F77F47
holding the note before her spectacles.
0x4BB7D646

0xDB06C2B2
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
0x99A476F4
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
0x548B123F
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
0x7FFA1D60

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
0xF5BFE81D

0xDB06C2B2
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
0x08AB18B1
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
0xDEE2D35F
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
0x5A144CE7
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
0x7A48952D
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
0x3B01BAB9
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
0xD1D79C23
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
0x23D99605
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
0x37760F08

0xDB06C2B2
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
0xD82530F0
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
0x514D20EF
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
0xB5F7947E
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
0x3BFB5689
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
0x3F320DBC
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
0x02444F64
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
0x50186944
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
0xFB1185E5
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
0xAF210554
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
0x58A0BACE
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
0x1FDBCEEB
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
0x83C64DC5
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
0xB59A8CC7
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
0xB43AD2AF
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
0x4790861C
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
0x5D2D5B6F
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
0xEA8C2C64
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
0x1F836690

0xDB06C2B2
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
0xA6BAB3A8
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
0x84E18534
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
0x700DE094
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
0x97FBB129
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
0x0271DFAD
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
0xE43D3DCC
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
0x6779CFC9
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
0xA50338A2
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
0xADFD40FD
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
0xBFBC1ACE
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
0xD10848B6
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
0x69B612BF
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
0x0A3E57AF
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
0x7EA8177C
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
0x57A8DB4E
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
0xC7F885CC
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
0x801F69DB
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
0x68BE22EC
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
0x87C68788
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
0x7765F7E2

0xDB06C2B2
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
0x2E962FFF
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
0xBFADE3B4
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
0x02C21D2D
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
0x6C05A376
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
0xAD8E7314
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
0x312FD81F

0xDB06C2B2
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
0x5177E420

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
0xC06C3C22
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
0x45136F12
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
0x3D93AB13
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
0xC2B6FAEA
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
0x86756D21
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
0xCE26A1E8
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
0x528CEEEF

0xDB06C2B2
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
0x7B85A6EE

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
0x748621AB
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
0x69386E5C
the money she gets."
0x2A1ED7B7

0xDB06C2B2
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
0x55D250D7

0xDB06C2B2
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
0x338382E8
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
0x859B6679

0xDB06C2B2
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
0xA181D144

0xDB06C2B2
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
0x1186BC21
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
0xB48E60F2
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
0x2FDA8134
excluded.
0x4838EDCB

0xDB06C2B2
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
0xD47D01B7
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
0x9E5128D4
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
0xDF25F1A0
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
0xE1B0C604
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
0x54ED7B9E
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
0x07232578
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
0x44680EA1
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
0x4A0B2E3E
sides.
0x69DE7C29

0xDB06C2B2
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
0xD51480F5
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
0xF9ED133F
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
0x1FC11C55
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
0xD9DE9644
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
0xFBFC60AD
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
0xF043F288
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
0x63DD1DE3
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
0x6DA8F5A5
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
0x9339E1B1

0xDB06C2B2
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
0x981DE560
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
0x4799AF78
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
0xCE0CF28B
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
0x167025B6

0xDB06C2B2
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
0xDB8F90D4
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
0x34AD6895
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
0xAE021738
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
0x30EEE1AD
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
0xF7CAA864
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
0x1056818B

0xDB06C2B2
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
0xB7D03863
minutes."
0x68345A37

0xDB06C2B2
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
0xF9E64A06
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
0x607874F0

0xDB06C2B2
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
0x6412CE2D
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
0xA527120A
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
0xD7E010CB
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
0xBF34D678
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
0x1AC71472
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
0xE596C1F6
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
0x3F10B1F7
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
0x56F2DD88
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
0x281C649F

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
0xB7239B83
below.
0xDCFB773A

0xDB06C2B2
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
0xC90E24B4
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
0x4878BA04
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
0x6ACDF06A
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
0xE667F633
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
0x4F69F3B0
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
0xCA9A08AF
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
0x303F8979

0xDB06C2B2
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
0x3E4420AA
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
0xE9386A41
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
0x7432A69E
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
0x08E7B0C4
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
0x7558A5DE
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
0xD422FF65
and, for a time, a hush.
0xEE63DAE9

0xDB06C2B2
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
0x85F32232
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
0x48FFD1A2

0xDB06C2B2
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
0xCEA8164F
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
0x901192DD
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
0xE310357D
on apprend."
0x096F6412

0xDB06C2B2
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
0x07691325

0xDB06C2B2
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
0xB767E258
mange."
0xD10B4127

0xDB06C2B2
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
0xE21D8BDE
get you something to eat."
0x0B18335E

0xDB06C2B2
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
0xE23D0977
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
0x4C3CAC31
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
0x4A582F81
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
0xB45EA1ED
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
0x8D77E3C6
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
0xAE685EBB
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
0xC0F119EA
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
0x77594D01
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
0x4F70C2B8
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
0xF18242BD
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
0x7D1F28AB
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
0x76C757AE
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
0xA72F80D2
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
0xD3692B3E
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
0x8C31D983
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
0x660B3BE1
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
0x69D3DF61

0xDB06C2B2
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
0xBBA2B7FF
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
0x1563162C
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
0x0F4AD34C
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
0x7EA2ED80
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
0x991A4982
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
0x22911EF0
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
0xB6B9483C

0xDB06C2B2
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
0x326AE959
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
0x58B5BABB
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
0x34525392
dinner?"
0xB3FEFE56

0xDB06C2B2
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
0xFB0DFCA4
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
0x7E900D25
is your dinner."
0x7DB633C8

0xDB06C2B2
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
0x2F8B14EB
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
0x618EE64F
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
0x84E72007
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
0x9CACB4FB
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
0xF21DC139
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
0x56A33514
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
0xAA66AEC5
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
0x91D6F125
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
0x15A3FC84
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
0xCE2A122D
quel dommage!"
0x2B08D218

0xDB06C2B2
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
0x8AEA13FA
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
0x423F74D9
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
0xB5B14EE4
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
0x86737398
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
0x5FB1B4A7
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
0x782CF493
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
0x95CDEA75
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
0x71A4B30B
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
0x05EB4178
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
0xD433A288
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
0x89370702
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
0x87DC6769
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
0xB234A5AB
by distance inarticulate, into words.
0x2D367BC8

0xDB06C2B2
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
0x99630682
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
0x9AE18C4A
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
0x9D474267
sought their chambers.
0x62EC74FB

0xDB06C2B2
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
0x78DBEBD4
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
0xABF63C51
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
0x568E0537
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
0xE04CB13F
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
0x6E5FA442
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
0xDA2ED6C1
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
0x21ABF0FE

0xDB06C2B2
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
0xB5D6F404
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
0xE47CA3C5
ladies."
0xE3BBB23B

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
0xB8768D90

0xDB06C2B2
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
0xFA177193
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
0xAAED51C8
never had a glimpse of it yet."
0xFA8C5774

0xDB06C2B2
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
0xD2F57C7F
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
0xCDFA92D7
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
0xAF5A3EAC
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
0x8831DC08

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
0xB8601106
answered.
0x1D2EF71E

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
0xFA1DD21C
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
0x34962A15
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
0x58A3E791
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
0xB23829B4
case of contumacy.'"
0x3717C5DA

0xDB06C2B2
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
0xB03A9C6F
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
0x15E9935D

0xDB06C2B2
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
0xD10F06B8
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
0xAF125324
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
0x90C8C2B8
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
0xE3626D98
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
0x9209675B
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
0x1A7753B4
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
0x2CBF3972

0xDB06C2B2
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
0xBF3F959D

0xDB06C2B2
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
0x4A7ACBC7
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
0xB1017203
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
0xB8B0E6C6
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
0xA1CE144E
stay at Thornfield."
0xDFA4B6AF

0xDB06C2B2
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
0x3A08A3D6
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
0x51FD1FB7
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
0x95757C0F
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
0xF4CB467B
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
0x0BD52386
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
0x70D107AD
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
0xD532F4CF
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
0x11439F78
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
0x8F52E0D0
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
0xD1DB89A1
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
0xADA9A8FE
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
0xF9A79CB8
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
0x0E64017A
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
0xADAD793C
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
0x1ACCA11E
descended.
0xD734BC4F

0xDB06C2B2
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
0x06E8D2C3
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
0x78215DA4
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
0x0FD6B770
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
0x49DF8466
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
0xFF1953F6
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
0x5017A07F
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
0xA669BAAD
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
0x69AE63AC

0xDB06C2B2
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
0xFBAE9199
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
0xFA8ECC76
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
0xB50D383C
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
0xB6899F96
touched my knee.
0x0D12BA98

0xDB06C2B2
"What is it, Adele?"
0x74B8A92B

0xDB06C2B2
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
0x7EA74B4A
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
0xD47B9776

0xDB06C2B2
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
0x0187C532
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
0x4DEBFFB6
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
0x8529DBFE
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
0xC954A558
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
0x1A615F08
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
0xFFB009B1

0xDB06C2B2
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
0xCFD95F37
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
0xC7B8A48F
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
0xD938C8BB
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
0xCE807CC1
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
0x912291AE

0xDB06C2B2
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
0xA4A782F7
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
0x4FB4BDAC
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
0xEE256275
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
0x0042CB1B
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
0x975A40FD
stared at me.
0x2E0799D8

0xDB06C2B2
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
0x895B072F
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
0xF3F07EFC
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
0x85CFB02B
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
0xD0EC7307
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
0xCAF93FA1
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
0x873157BD
and may as well mention them now.
0x433E7747

0xDB06C2B2
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
0xF9B45901
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
0x4BE5B8E5
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
0xBE51EF3E
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
0x381A414C
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
0x4ADF580C
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
0x0732445E
both sisters were fair as lilies.
0xC9BD46D6

0xDB06C2B2
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
0x0A153B2C
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
0xC13B9D45
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
0x253EFDD5
within the circlet of a band of gems.
0x05DAD32F

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
0x466D9E9B
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
0xAB24B361
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
0x39FF68B9
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
0x724A60BA

0xDB06C2B2
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
0x807C0499
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
0x5170DDCE
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
0xDD23E88C
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
0xA8242D8B
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
0x715F6283
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
0x0D87A4A5
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
0x76F7288A
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
0x581BFC97
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
0x1AAFA74A
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
0x6F139280
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
0xA56D8705
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
0x10ED3F43
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
0x8B7BC9E8
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
0x4BB8B53C
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
0xF76A0C87
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
0x355ABD41
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
0x3DDD0387
truly imperial dignity.
0xB6328535

0xDB06C2B2
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
0x2A9036F5
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
0x8BB6B1EC
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
0xCFEF17BF
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
0x01D695F0
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
0xBF5C0EBB
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
0x3AD1451F
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
0xAE7C992D

0xDB06C2B2
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
0x1620FA97
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
0x12F8674F
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
0x583224A1
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
0xE7BDA25A
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
0x7DD148F5
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
0xA019663D
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
0x2996DD4C
haughty lip.
0x7881D926

0xDB06C2B2
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
0x25CE9BC4
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
0x79D5C755
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
0xC69BB8F2
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
0x46AA85E1
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
0xBE767BAD
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
0xEEE8704E
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
0x5D07A3DA
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
0x82976F98
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
0x43D68186
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
0xF5D5D573
with fluency and with a good accent.
0xD867170B

0xDB06C2B2
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
0xF0962875
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
0xD8621755
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
0xDB6A38EC
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
0xCF76994A
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
0x1BDFB90C
in spotless white.
0xF1DD17A5

0xDB06C2B2
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
0x80667057
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
0x92A20AF2
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
0x7EC94D12
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
0x12F5B4B1
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
0xDFD73E5D
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
0x4D8D69E7
together.
0x27B32003

0xDB06C2B2
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
0xC67F9B88
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
0x38B7EC3E
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
0x157469B3
gravity--
0x22450A08

0xDB06C2B2
"Bon jour, mesdames."
0xE7B08A26

0xDB06C2B2
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
0xA9E2B7F0
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
0x9E7019F6

0xDB06C2B2
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
0x89EB40D0
little French girl he was speaking of."
0xDA911837

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
0x5F5E47DB

0xDB06C2B2
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
0x0FEF3CFC
child!"
0x255DD91E

0xDB06C2B2
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
0xD962DED5
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
0x8E83C996
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
0x55F3E65D
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
0x8CD3D13E

0xDB06C2B2
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
0xF19D7976
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
0xB0FEA72E
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
0x8983F8E3
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
0x5C1DDD8C
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
0x612DD0A1
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
0x4A4C128D
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
0x4C2374C8
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
0xA2B560C0
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
0x854420BA
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
0xE54EDEF4
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
0x89107C85
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
0xCAD2944C
blood or vigour of brain.
0xF6344C02

0xDB06C2B2
And where is Mr. Rochester?
0xE5B9CC65

0xDB06C2B2
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
0x7DF40F65
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
0xC40604A7
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
0x8E1775BC
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
0x879F071F
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
0x75A68042
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
0x7BCD7B8B
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
0xE222DF67
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
0xF7BDD2D9
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
0xC017ABAB
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
0xA2418A18
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
0x0DFA6701
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
0xB51A444D
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
0x2D82B272
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
0x3A0955AE

0xDB06C2B2
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
0x8ED245D3
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
0x7CC3A1D1
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
0x18B43F9F
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
0x77D22D22
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
0xF6C70AB0
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
0xA69E95D7
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
0xC2A2E5E4
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
0x69DAFAF2

0xDB06C2B2
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
0x643FBA63
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
0x569B08E6
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
0x5444317E
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
0x0091F2FF
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
0x6433B30F
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
0xC4AAC467
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
0x7FE4433C
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
0xA560928E
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
0x78F37336
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
0xDF02B9BD

0xDB06C2B2
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
0xAD69F82F
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
0xA8073453
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
0xC410369F
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
0x1CBE5EF8
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
0xA53E6457
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
0x034CD51B
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
0x2ED14708
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
0x15367A7C
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
0x59819AD6
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
0xD35C7912
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
0x64303060
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
0x7E52AAE3
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
0x70DB80C8
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
0x40512A6D
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
0xD6AF76EE
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
0x8961C874
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
0xE79A9E2B
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
0xE83BCA79
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
0xA28BA991
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
0x0737B513
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
0x2D20451E
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
0x57A0E893
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
0x6802983A
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
0xE9D95312
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
0xFCE11F70
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
0x0A0920C9
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
0x77AE2033
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
0x8D1C3E7D
breathe and think, I must love him."
0x47912144

0xDB06C2B2
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
0x3A61A648
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
0xA4298AB8
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
0xA2C1C09F
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
0x1A2AB584
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
0x0FCD457D
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
0x5776A233
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
0xE595A97C
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
0x7E55F5AF
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
0x01D937DE
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
0x49B583C2
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
0x1F058E1A
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
0x16D4C1CD
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
0xF219B63F
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
0x933206A8
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
0xBC14B668
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
0xF4BD2E38
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
0x80C140C2
selects a mate.
0x88D38418

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
0x3A468133
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
0xFD71FAC8
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
0xE1DC4169

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
0x1EC3488B

0xDB06C2B2
"Nor am I."
0xC1D971E3

0xDB06C2B2
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
0x4B817E1E
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
0x6760FE2D

0xDB06C2B2
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
0x671FBA7E

0xDB06C2B2
"You should have sent her to school."
0x3FBA9B9A

0xDB06C2B2
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."
0x8BE33565

0xDB06C2B2
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
0xADF2DD20
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
0x1E669FCF
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
0xA79CC265
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."
0x55740927

0xDB06C2B2
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.
0xD352475B
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the
0xF3F465AE
shade: but he never turned his eyes.
0x1B47D520

0xDB06C2B2
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking
0xA584E045
straight before him.
0x74EECABE

0xDB06C2B2
"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear
0xB5BC2A2C
mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
0x503959B3
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
0x6EB4E310
ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?"
0xD61BFA88

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you speak, my own?"
0x8A7D52A0

0xDB06C2B2
The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated
0x4E28BD25
her question with an explanation.
0x3C37DF4F

0xDB06C2B2
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I
0xEED8D729
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank
0x9DC52386
Heaven I have now done with them!"
0x0FBD492F

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
0x2006EA29
ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of
0xC360E34C
the anathematised race was present.
0xD801BB63

0xDB06C2B2
"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!"  Then, in a
0x20C75A7B
lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a
0xD734B398
judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
0xE2E4DF96

0xDB06C2B2
"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.
0x91DBA1FC

0xDB06C2B2
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
0xC49553F8
three times with portentous significancy.
0xB37AD4B2

0xDB06C2B2
"But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now."
0x8856FE00

0xDB06C2B2
"Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I."
0x34C85307

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the
0x612EE73C
whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
0xAACFBC6E
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
0x14C49D4E
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
0x2B32E6BE
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
0x71840132
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
0xE7DC01AD
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
0x23F6BD22
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
0xA0A4C941
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
0x436ADB40
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
0x772AC315
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
0x786243A5
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"
0x1CD2E700

0xDB06C2B2
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
0xA1CFABCD
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
0x991C37D2
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
0x8066BE8F
when she was herself so ignorant."
0x9D661C23

0xDB06C2B2
"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or
0x6EBB92DA
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
0x3A697D5D
we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in
0x22DA5B4A
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
0x9E2F6CF2
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
0x51EFB2CB
passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our
0x7C0D15F1
discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights
0xEB8F6BB6
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
0xAF45CBD2
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my
0xEE8B61A9
lady-mother?"
0x47088FF0

0xDB06C2B2
"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a
0x7F77123D
thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never
0x5F332E00
be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--"
0x2E1CAA59

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know
0x83368B3B
them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and
0xFF393311
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance
0x770E8C17
and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny
0xDB371232
and general blow-up.  Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"
0x2CE849DC

0xDB06C2B2
"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."
0x63398775

0xDB06C2B2
"Then no more need be said: change the subject."
0x5D9D3CB2

0xDB06C2B2
Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
0x0116DA06
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
0x641FFA1A
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her
0x73294CE2
out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"
0xFFCF23A6

0xDB06C2B2
"No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her
0x54D67F6E
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
0x83FC33B8
she would give us anything we asked for."
0xBE11E1DE

0xDB06C2B2
"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we
0xA3876CF2
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in
0xB5F0E7AD
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new
0xD17BA749
topic.  Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
0x512D0104

0xDB06C2B2
"Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other."
0x57482F2D

0xDB06C2B2
"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.  Signior Eduardo, are you
0x71C2E4E6
in voice to-night?"
0x2B56BDBA

0xDB06C2B2
"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."
0x8EF34909

0xDB06C2B2
"Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs
0x82A30135
and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service."
0x8ABD63D3

0xDB06C2B2
"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"
0xC62CAE1B

0xDB06C2B2
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
0xE61081EC
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
0xDCFF3F87
been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind
0x55CD042C
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
0x48C398AB
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
0x0AF21574
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my
0xEF92BC97
hand."
0x4BD127F1

0xDB06C2B2
"Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried
0x326D6712
Mr. Rochester.
0x04210A20

0xDB06C2B2
"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.
0x7B4C67BB

0xDB06C2B2
"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.
0xAAD37813

0xDB06C2B2
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
0x3491DD32
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
0x42D10882
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
0xB29BACBE
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
0x4FCFFA2E
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
0x56094FB3
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
0x42DDD549

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
0x43B4AC1A
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
0x79B00BA4
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
0x2868607F
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
0x82602881
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
0xCB437A03
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
0x00006B9C
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
0x4420BBBF
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
0x2000016D
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
0x5E0E79CB
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
0xCFBABCCD
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."
0x555FFE2E

0xDB06C2B2
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
0x806B8880
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
0x98704AEB
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
0x07E541EE
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
0xA2FF9365
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
0x63FD2A4E

0xDB06C2B2
"I am all obedience," was the response.
0x10B84A92

0xDB06C2B2
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that
0xD2F2F3CE
reason, sing it _con spirito_."
0x3EBCAFB6

0xDB06C2B2
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and
0x36AE3F5D
water."
0x9FCA8C46

0xDB06C2B2
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how
0x07D7392E
such things _should_ be done."
0xC0591FAD

0xDB06C2B2
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to
0xE60F8409
fail."
0xBA8BFA72

0xDB06C2B2
"Gardez-vous en bien!  If you err wilfully, I shall devise a
0x15536A14
proportionate punishment."
0xFA05FD8C

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict
0x77AFD66F
a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
0x7D6CB140

0xDB06C2B2
"Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.
0x52BFF7EA

0xDB06C2B2
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must
0x54384A13
inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
0xA46ABD69
capital punishment."
0x3B53EF9F

0xDB06C2B2
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
0x41DE8637
accompaniment in spirited style.
0x86B499F6

0xDB06C2B2
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
0x29ACB277
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
0xA12EC6FF
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
0x260D9AF0
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
0xEFBB8B53
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
0x0AE1F13D
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
0x93D97D0B
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
0x405A9173
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
0x5AD378FB
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
0x44014DCF
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
0x39FA597B
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
0x19D2DACE
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
0x62CD6AD6

0xDB06C2B2
"How do you do?" he asked.
0xA4525920

0xDB06C2B2
"I am very well, sir."
0x4093DBC2

0xDB06C2B2
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
0xB7B35866

0xDB06C2B2
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
0x18671FAF
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
0x83ED7321

0xDB06C2B2
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
0x07B07F78

0xDB06C2B2
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
0x433554DB

0xDB06C2B2
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
0x40436E05

0xDB06C2B2
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
0x9F64A4AA
What is the matter?"
0x02766716

0xDB06C2B2
"Nothing at all, sir."
0x34C02026

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
0x3EA34478

0xDB06C2B2
"Not the least."
0xAA890BC4

0xDB06C2B2
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
0x0F50AFFC

0xDB06C2B2
"I am tired, sir."
0xD5B9DD16

0xDB06C2B2
He looked at me for a minute.
0xDF47F5DD

0xDB06C2B2
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
0xCA0F0DEA

0xDB06C2B2
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
0x32FB36D7

0xDB06C2B2
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
0x85B1E89A
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
0x3CF3C4A7
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
0xDE86AF2F
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
0x3AF527C6
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
0x68725DBC
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
0x512D0EDB
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
0x8E0325FD
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
0xF4B4123D
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.

CHAPTER XVIII
0x0030D293

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
0x4E774C3D
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
0x8163B984
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
0x0BE060D0
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
0x124EBE7D
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
0x2D51E4E1
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
0x5FBA87DE
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
0xA0B0F8E4

0xDB06C2B2
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
0xDA728536
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
0xCDF313A3
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
0x3578F5BE
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
0xF6EB15DC
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
0x37E07BA7
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
0xEACD2EFD
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
0x4EE99DA1

0xDB06C2B2
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
0xA940B11E
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
0x6F0719FA
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
0x98B497EF
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
0xD2F85565
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
0xC2270037
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
0x230278EE
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
0xC8657FC4
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
0x6C583BEA
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
0xE0A24D18
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
0x28B007FB
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
0xDB686A83
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
0xEDC71892
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
0xACC8E15F
drawing-room.
0xA0C0CC8B

0xDB06C2B2
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
0x49B38953
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
0xE3CE5C33
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
0x321367F6
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
0xF30233F1
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
0xA1C36F08

0xDB06C2B2
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
0x91AAD31A
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
0x0697A640
usual seat.
0x5CDD912E

0xDB06C2B2
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
0x516BCB64
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
0x0EFDC713
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
0x71203862
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
0xEFC421EF

0xDB06C2B2
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
0x5370E9AC

0xDB06C2B2
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
0xC88F296C
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
0x6A6274A3
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
0xA4973728
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
0x35EE17A6
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
0xE95FDC3F
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
0x8207CF74
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
0x3C4209D1
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
0x77851267
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
0x1B8E3EC1
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
0xC5C28E93
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
0xC0031D79
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
0x26266D2C
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
0xDC4BB281
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
0x2F33EF3E
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
0x476A9EA3

0xDB06C2B2
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
0xA7705E12

0xDB06C2B2
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
0xA4966F0E
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
0xC53E4F02
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
0x50A2F616
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
0x768E43BE
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
0xAF66474E
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
0x115186D1
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
0xA7C697EE
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
0xF48D139C

0xDB06C2B2
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
0x9E773F62
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
0xAE53C114
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
0x30504D5F
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
0xB1299F39
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
0xDE50B67F
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
0xF6CFDB22
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
0x23F5A1D8
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
0x34A2E90A
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
0x0622EED5
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
0xC7FA6D80
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
0x1B64139E
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
0x8F5997AF

0xDB06C2B2
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
0x36D23591
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
0xD00B6005
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
0xC061935C
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
0xFA84A07B
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
0xEE60E875
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
0xD42EC3BC
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
0x644EB54E
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
0x2B649A24
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
0xB95155BC
wanting.
0x5446F02D

0xDB06C2B2
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
0x4BF8C8CC
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
0xE5907454
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
0xD43A5729
curtain again descended.
0xE913E8D5

0xDB06C2B2
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
0x77DD5127
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
0x9F827325
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
0xB2CB4727
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
0xC4950F08
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
0xFEFB7BF5

0xDB06C2B2
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
0xAEF34410
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
0xB547EF98
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
0x1D1C45AE
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
0xEEB9F58E
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
0xFB8A6C9C
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
0x886B55D9
attached fetters.
0x885038C1

0xDB06C2B2
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
0xF85F369B

0xDB06C2B2
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
0x73F3461C
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
0x2DC926F2
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
0x4B9393B5

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
0x1D432D3D
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
0xC6FC11D2
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
0xE80B8DA2

0xDB06C2B2
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
0xEB5E3478

0xDB06C2B2
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
0x673C797B
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
0x3702429D

0xDB06C2B2
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
0xFDBE38F4

0xDB06C2B2
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
0x78316316
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
0x480C9B6F

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
0xBD333052
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
0x673D7E9D
colour rose.
0xA06EEF82

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
0x0E47541C
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
0x490C78DD
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
0x72929C89
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
0xC64EAF54
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
0x6214B5C8
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
0xD3D3793A
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
0x97615A53
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
0x1949BDC9
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
0xB6F6EC2A
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
0xD51DD923
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
0xA8A15497
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
0x717ABC4B
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
0xCA14C0FC
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
0xD3D8C18C
returns in memory at this moment.
0xB2E3BB2E

0xDB06C2B2
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
0xD33D6EE5
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
0x62B54ED6
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
0x0CF37BA5
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
0x32834C97
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
0x0D3DE3E8
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
0x2241AF88
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
0x670C2520
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
0x4FA6CFAE
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
0xA0AC160C
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
0xA79E5F0A
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
0x96A42D56
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
0xE2F46C39
very pride, irresistible.
0xD5001E51

0xDB06C2B2
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
0x3786DE64
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
0x9318BB1B
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
0xE8F6363D
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
0x1C1DC341
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
0xA2218128
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
0x7E8934FB
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
0xAD6F0641
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
0x6B120F4F
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
0x095A68A8
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
0x88BC2E2F
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
0x7299BE9E
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
0xE7AA43A2
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
0x7FF55D99
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
0x65DEF5B4
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
0xEE383928
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
0x13163399
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
0x5E2AB623
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
0x9D43232A
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
0xD26CEB67
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
0x9C799C5F
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
0x6014278B
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
0xBEB05450
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
0xC9F75DC8
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
0x5E9BFDD3
torturing pain arose.
0xFB700706

0xDB06C2B2
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
0xF874F03B
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
0x1CF019A1
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
0x97D91771
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
0x75E8A860
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
0x1E2D636D
not charm him_.
0xE7E7C5AB

0xDB06C2B2
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
0x1D5C36AA
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
0xF44993B7
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
0x46604897
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
0xF52FE7C3
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
0x21DFC16A
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
0x09C9FAA8
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
0xCE4C3AE3
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
0x6E47101B
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
0x3B968188
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
0xA83AD546
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
0xD310BFC0
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
0xDFCDBD5F
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
0x82808385
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
0xD69EA635
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
0x3263D230

0xDB06C2B2
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
0x85301BF6
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
0xB8C86119
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
0xDBEE7425
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
0x98C8937E
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
0x262FE933
silent conquest might have been won.
0x0E77F6FD

0xDB06C2B2
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
0x03CBA03A
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
0x37D97FDB
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
0x15422B4D
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
0x17E4A770
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
0x55B75936
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
0xCF862AD8
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
0xD7750E34
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
0x7BD3E2B3
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
0xBE0DBE62
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
0xA55CFFA7
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
0x48DEBAA2
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
0x18660D03
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
0xDA00B719
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
0x7F6CF75F
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
0xD838904A
shines on."
0xED294B6E

0xDB06C2B2
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
0xC325BB0B
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
0x8321587C
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
0xC0E207BA
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
0xC56E26D2
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
0x081A55AB
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
0x9E44C049
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
0x90C0FFC2
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
0x9FF42072
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
0x7CA1E026
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
0xA1C2056A
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
0xF4615BD4
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
0x1DC359DC
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
0xEC541866
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
0x5923CE0E
as I wished to act.
0xBC2D8594

0xDB06C2B2
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
0x8A400462
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
0xD2C6B21F
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
0xD1D58338
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
0x17B5286B
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
0x13FB8D14
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
0x0677E665
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
0x146299F3
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
0x23F8E6F9
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
0x3E34BE13
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
0x609FBFAC
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
0x2BDC8C6A
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
0x0290D1DF
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
0x0C963BD8
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
0x308AB3EA
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
0x0A1F1750
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
0x8B874491
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
0x600871EE
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
0x79FB6EA8
nature.
0x98D59617

0xDB06C2B2
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
0x432B11C4
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
0x0325C118
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
0xA2151D47
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
0x5CBB6183
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
0x85EA084B
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
0x3C5F18C1
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
0x99A32C95
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
0x207B6771
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
0x06C71557
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
0xCFFA7F53
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
0xEA56F985
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
0x09A4941C
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
0x7A349F28
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
0x270FEA8E
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
0x6DE7B095
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
0x7790873A
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
0xD6E565B7
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
0x742F054A
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
0x251F982A
vivacity of conversation.
0xB02267C4

0xDB06C2B2
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
0xFE6E77A6
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
0x17100B0D
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
0xCD8426F0
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
0xC5893623
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
0x2D235EB4
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
0x83217FF9
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
0x97C30DD2
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
0xDC9AB005
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
0x6CF78365
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
0xEDE525D8
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
0x3B5E4931
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
0x30EA0213
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
0xF07DDF98
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
0x179AADA1
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
0xC9AC9FEE

0xDB06C2B2
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
0x8DC0C59D
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
0xBA4A2CE4
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
0xE52D599B

0xDB06C2B2
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
0x8C88F786

0xDB06C2B2
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
0x2D57F6DD
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
0x9067AEC7
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
0xF2B11E99
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
0x4143B896

0xDB06C2B2
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
0x0C65255A
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
0x6F584609
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
0x9F89EEEB

0xDB06C2B2
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
0x3379BAC3
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
0x11D40E50
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
0x6ED50050
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
0xEF897913
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
0x0B327FE5
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
0xEF38A029
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
0xB672B937

0xDB06C2B2
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
0x22131CDA
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
0x552A0FF6
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
0x3023C858

0xDB06C2B2
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
0x9B0329EA
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
0xE7CABCFC

0xDB06C2B2
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
0xB2C378B7
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
0x867E60DE
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
0x03BDF46E
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
0x1F9CD0FB

0xDB06C2B2
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
0x2BEB55D4
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
0xD551186E
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
0x8565C162
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
0x2FFEF489
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
0xF01E9AB3
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
0x5CE8BE52
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
0xBB5EBC68
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
0xB0227931
least so I thought.
0x25580B1F

0xDB06C2B2
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
0xB5B01E40
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
0xCA9D15C4
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
0xB5A7C48C
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
0x21AC2064
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
0x660F965C
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
0x1A18FC89
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
0x137E0EA6
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
0x833E3141
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
0x1CAAFC6B
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
0xB993DAEB

0xDB06C2B2
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
0xBFB0B494
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
0x2D220386
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
0x5EEAC6E1
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
0x7EA5C1A8
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
0xF7B258B4
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
0xEC15603C
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
0x6AB81B5D

0xDB06C2B2
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
0x7C67125F
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
0x7E90F10B
that "extremes meet."
0xF3073D5D

0xDB06C2B2
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
0x9EF22DF0
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
0x0339515E
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
0x303D8EE1
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
0xE9FF775C
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
0x2E8CCB19
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
0xEE9CE491
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
0x5AC6948B
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
0xB587A1E8

0xDB06C2B2
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
0xB5D60611
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
0x243B9FFC
a placid eye and smile!"
0x27A11919

0xDB06C2B2
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
0x83069B98
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
0x5BEB1686
Hay Common.
0xA4B1EB17

0xDB06C2B2
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
0x607852D7
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
0x92DA8C57
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
0xFABB94EE
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
0xC140FE1F
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
0x0870C888
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
0xFBD90D4C
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
0x852FC8DA
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
0xBD2E3149
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
0xAE833695
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
0x9639299E
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
0xCF1084FB
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
0x4A1AFFD2
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
0x637FDFE0

0xDB06C2B2
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
0xF60B7DC2
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
0x487ED537
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
0x755928E3
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
0x7CB6FBED
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
0xEAC8F8A4
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
0x1D0F147B
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
0xA786BCEC

0xDB06C2B2
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
0xBF708B1C
off," replied the magistrate.
0x6F48D301

0xDB06C2B2
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
0xD0CF0A9C
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
0x8195D1CF
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
0x70992E30
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
0x8CD9244B
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
0xF4E70355
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
0xC4F96AD8
see her?"
0xADD8B693

0xDB06C2B2
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
0x5302AD84
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
0x56755C27

0xDB06C2B2
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
0x5F523554
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
0x67D7D97F
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
0xE61D8DA2
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
0x5B98F786

0xDB06C2B2
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
0xC325DF1D

0xDB06C2B2
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
0x0468BFE8
must and will do it."
0xF13DDDD9

0xDB06C2B2
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
0x33255D13

0xDB06C2B2
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
0xDC580EC4

0xDB06C2B2
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
0xB51C369C
in, of course."
0x55C77610

0xDB06C2B2
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
0x6B1C8D4E
throw away such a chance of fun."
0x3EADF7FE

0xDB06C2B2
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
0x5DD6F709

0xDB06C2B2
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
0x164150F4
in the Dowager Ingram.
0x9F3ED80B

0xDB06C2B2
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
0x43FDB9D6
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
0x8E91EF22
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
0xC0A9C40E
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
0x97BE1D86
forward."
0x982AB26D

0xDB06C2B2
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
0x43508D61

0xDB06C2B2
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
0x2B95C3F3
Sam!"
0x232F00F7

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
0x2197757D
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
0x525C8ADD

0xDB06C2B2
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
0x54E41F1F

0xDB06C2B2
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
0x4B7C5CB7

0xDB06C2B2
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
0x2A24B022
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
0xD2DB77A6

0xDB06C2B2
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
0x278290B6
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
0x91994F04
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
0xB4328EE8
one."
0x518727E4

0xDB06C2B2
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
0x8D1BCEEE
advised, my angel girl--and--"
0xB7CFF175

0xDB06C2B2
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
0x43AC6326
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
0x7B0CD9E3
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
0xB2EEBE26

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
0xC8B7F2FD

0xDB06C2B2
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
0xD1CC7EF8

0xDB06C2B2
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
0xF272E5D2
once more.
0xEEE68CD1

0xDB06C2B2
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
0x541F2BD1
know who will be her first visitor."
0x2BDD88C0

0xDB06C2B2
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
0xE49752D0
said Colonel Dent.
0x8ED782F7

0xDB06C2B2
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
0x44588CA9

0xDB06C2B2
Sam went and returned.
0x7B4031AE

0xDB06C2B2
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
0xF9D536EE
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
0xD6B59892
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
0xF9C9D23D

0xDB06C2B2
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
0x5AB15065

0xDB06C2B2
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
0x4A3FF2FD
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
0xADB8ED56
of his men.
0xE76FAB4A

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
0xFA31FE30
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
0x8075B544
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
0x00B96501

0xDB06C2B2
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
0xA342492A
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
0x87E805BF
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
0x76D4C9F6
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
0xD07478E9

0xDB06C2B2
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
0x232578B1
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
0x84804381

0xDB06C2B2
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
0xB32D117A
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
0x78D3D63A
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
0x9D3FC9B8
her seat, and took it in silence.
0x51C065C6

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
0x98FED7E9

0xDB06C2B2
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
0xDC399AD2

0xDB06C2B2
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
0x0E3EA2B0
demanded the Misses Eshton.
0xC8B4DD48

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
0x56FE7826
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
0x09240FB7
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
0xB7F4D0F3
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
0x118053F2
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
0xB4F2885D
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
0x7B7F255F
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
0x2142386F
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
0x8465A274
morning, as he threatened."
0x352EA52C

0xDB06C2B2
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
0x60411B8E
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
0x827EF4B8
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
0x9A150635
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
0x9F3885D1
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
0xF6A9AD00
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
0x5E94C95F
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
0x19860BAD
whatever revelations had been made her.
0xC9E56A6B

0xDB06C2B2
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
0xEA459408

0xDB06C2B2
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
0xBBFFB833
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
0xBC452604
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
0x7FC21D53
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
0x361B3AA8
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
0x00A6F3C8
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
0x03CB3BF6

0xDB06C2B2
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
0xAB1C5FCE
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
0xB380EE73
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
0xB23AAA6B
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
0x53A8ECFD

0xDB06C2B2
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
0xD2D01215
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
0xCB6E641B
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
0xA40B0150

0xDB06C2B2
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
0x0D079B4D
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
0x6038B67F
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
0xA53869EB
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
0x7EB1DAC8
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
0x7ED3003B
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
0x43DCD983
they most wished for.
0x50A85F58

0xDB06C2B2
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
0x12A4475F
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
0xB185DD79
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
0x8BEF06E8
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
0xF5F9454D
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
0xB1625A7D
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
0xC17CD98D
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
0x9C92523B

0xDB06C2B2
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
0x52AF5635
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
0xB0D6BF97
saw Sam.
0xC9980777

0xDB06C2B2
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
0x42D465D1
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
0xC58595FB
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
0x85600F98
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
0xF29DAC81

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
0x736C6CF5
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
0x1EEB47C0
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
0x3DFFF99E
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
0xD769F944
quietly behind me.
0x708CC086

0xDB06C2B2
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
0xF24EE56D
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
0x4703F6B0

0xDB06C2B2
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
0x26F46B7B
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
0x36DD2A4D

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
CHAPTER XIX
0x9216BCC1

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
0xCA56E0F4
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
0xF28DE60B
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
0x64CD1599
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
0x7C046392
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
0x71143892
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
0x9D7E9EE9
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
0xBF95895E
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
0xC0F56B49
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
0x853FE2DD

0xDB06C2B2
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
0x0046961E
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
0x6282CB17
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
0xBC268E36
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
0x4B9CA1EB
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
0x03B5E3BA
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
0x95B0CA1E
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
0x12DB3DB8
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
0x5C911D74
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
0x01C7B4D7

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
0xD263767C
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
0x6812D264

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
0xDBB1F755
warn you, I have no faith."
0xC1D70711

0xDB06C2B2
"It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in
0x39802536
your step as you crossed the threshold."
0xCC07EE77

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you?  You've a quick ear."
0x9B3ECD06

0xDB06C2B2
"I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."
0x46C42D01

0xDB06C2B2
"You need them all in your trade."
0x727B1029

0xDB06C2B2
"I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with.  Why don't
0x3BBC6A8E
you tremble?"
0x364A2E00

0xDB06C2B2
"I'm not cold."
0x624AA683

0xDB06C2B2
"Why don't you turn pale?"
0x8A396C1B

0xDB06C2B2
"I am not sick."
0x91A3A093

0xDB06C2B2
"Why don't you consult my art?"
0xA66A2A4D

0xDB06C2B2
"I'm not silly."
0xBED2CCB0

0xDB06C2B2
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
0x78CD583F
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
0x3C19C71F
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
0xF938E748
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
0x3DE6531A
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
0xBC93380F

0xDB06C2B2
"Prove it," I rejoined.
0xD6351004

0xDB06C2B2
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
0xB9F88275
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
0x2FD74A7F
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
0xB09A244E
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
0xA68A0F81
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits
0x6C9A8C8B
you."
0xEED23204

0xDB06C2B2
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
0x8B633703
with vigour.
0x21ADFD30

0xDB06C2B2
"You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
0xEE3272F2
solitary dependent in a great house."
0xEB181A8F

0xDB06C2B2
"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
0x4B46B197
one?"
0x494D449C

0xDB06C2B2
"In my circumstances."
0x122F1D8E

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
0x869EE8FB
placed as you are."
0xD6AF8A5F

0xDB06C2B2
"It would be easy to find you thousands."
0x8C115DA2

0xDB06C2B2
"You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly
0x03E84F34
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials
0x618B771B
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance
0xEB29DD25
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."
0x5731208B

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't understand enigmas.  I never could guess a riddle in my life."
0xC4CC20FF

0xDB06C2B2
"If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."
0xBC22FF17

0xDB06C2B2
"And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"
0x85151C8A

0xDB06C2B2
"To be sure."
0x705E8923

0xDB06C2B2
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
0xA5D605D8
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
0x998C3556
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
0xF8462A73
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
0x81E8CE84

0xDB06C2B2
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
0xA927A3D3
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written
0xFAF8E841
there."
0xB042A738

0xDB06C2B2
"I believe you," said I.
0x569732A7

0xDB06C2B2
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
0x7BBF1FC2
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."
0x4E84B379

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall
0x69512CD1
begin to put some faith in you presently."
0x8624F4CB

0xDB06C2B2
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
0x1422CE52
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
0x6699FAF0
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
0xDF052D0B

0xDB06C2B2
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
0x194E74D7
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
0x594734B9
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
0x01807D0E
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
0x9F370A31
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
0x9991A80E
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."
0x9CAA4905

0xDB06C2B2
"I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."
0xCFEE377B

0xDB06C2B2
"Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
0x105992EA
whispers of the future?"
0x9A09B62B

0xDB06C2B2
"Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to
0xE1E18BF3
set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."
0x656186FB

0xDB06C2B2
"A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-
0x838D5EE2
seat (you see I know your habits )--"
0x9FD605AC

0xDB06C2B2
"You have learned them from the servants."
0xC6F0CFD9

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah! you think yourself sharp.  Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
0xB7CFCDD9
have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole--"
0x64F198C6

0xDB06C2B2
I started to my feet when I heard the name.
0x757CF643

0xDB06C2B2
"You have--have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business
0xB5FB0F54
after all, then!"
0xE06D7097

0xDB06C2B2
"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is
0xB22D9B04
Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But,
0xBC299B4E
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but
0x2FD27267
your future school?  Have you no present interest in any of the company
0x68592050
who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?  Is there not one face you
0xCA8A08E6
study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?"
0x46D2981C

0xDB06C2B2
"I like to observe all the faces and all the figures."
0xCE32BDAF

0xDB06C2B2
"But do you never single one from the rest--or it may be, two?"
0x8A6FCEA4

0xDB06C2B2
"I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
0xAE4486E0
tale: it amuses me to watch them."
0x8B2CF16B

0xDB06C2B2
"What tale do you like best to hear?"
0x9A4B08F8

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, I have not much choice!  They generally run on the same
0x0439F03A
theme--courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe--marriage."
0xB8275DAA

0xDB06C2B2
"And do you like that monotonous theme?"
0xAA6C217A

0xDB06C2B2
"Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."
0x9E08E2B8

0xDB06C2B2
"Nothing to you?  When a lady, young and full of life and health,
0x54628557
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits
0x18F3E65D
and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you--"
0x359844F7

0xDB06C2B2
"I what?"
0x9ACB3D8D

0xDB06C2B2
"You know--and perhaps think well of."
0x9221877E

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't know the gentlemen here.  I have scarcely interchanged a
0x8AA90B3D
syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
0x4C5C153C
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
0xD97F935E
dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
0x418B33FF
be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
0xEB6B8094
disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
0xB7900C18

0xDB06C2B2
"You don't know the gentlemen here?  You have not exchanged a syllable
0xEB549515
with one of them?  Will you say that of the master of the house!"
0x4A49BF15

0xDB06C2B2
"He is not at home."
0x4FB08008

0xDB06C2B2
"A profound remark!  A most ingenious quibble!  He went to Millcote this
0x53F07023
morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
0x0226103C
circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as
0x89910CBF
it were, out of existence?"
0x66E56E69

0xDB06C2B2
"No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
0x3CB4CA5E
you had introduced."
0xA4496C38

0xDB06C2B2
"I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so
0x11C3EFE1
many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow
0xB197DAED
like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?"
0x2A127C80

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests."
0xCC72D2CD

0xDB06C2B2
"No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
0x0C62E385
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with
0x92117B32
the most lively and the most continuous?"
0xC795CE07

0xDB06C2B2
"The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator."  I said
0x40158035
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
0x7A039E28
manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.  One unexpected
0x32C8E4D0
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
0x65AB583A
of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
0x69C56298
weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.
0xAB96865B

0xDB06C2B2
"Eagerness of a listener!" repeated she: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
0xF82410C8
the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight
0x46D1EBC5
in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to
0xB39A9E8E
receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have
0xA1D1B6FB
noticed this?"
0xABE66225

0xDB06C2B2
"Grateful!  I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face."
0x48C69084

0xDB06C2B2
"Detecting!  You have analysed, then.  And what did you detect, if not
0xC3F3C99D
gratitude?"
0x8A63A523

0xDB06C2B2
I said nothing.
0x19BDE707

0xDB06C2B2
"You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen
0x985C8F38
him married, and beheld his bride happy?"
0x50453F02

0xDB06C2B2
"Humph!  Not exactly.  Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes."
0xFF96D7CA

0xDB06C2B2
"What the devil have you seen, then?"
0x72852807

0xDB06C2B2
"Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.  Is it known that
0xC93902F7
Mr. Rochester is to be married?"
0xAE5916B8

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram."
0x293495FA

0xDB06C2B2
"Shortly?"
0x24EEB7F9

0xDB06C2B2
"Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
0x9835ABF1
an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
0xF46714B3
they will be a superlatively happy pair.  He must love such a handsome,
0x58AFF339
noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
0x2E1C10C1
his person, at least his purse.  I know she considers the Rochester
0xFD293338
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
0x12C90514
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
0x4697D91D
grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.  I would advise her
0xC23B9C75
blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
0x16E2F5E8
clearer rent-roll,--he's dished--"
0xC9B7E819

0xDB06C2B2
"But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to
0x454E8371
hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it."
0xD7949663

0xDB06C2B2
"Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
0x2758CD93
contradicted another.  Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
0x5E152F83
I know.  I knew it before I came here this evening.  She has laid it
0xF28373E2
carefully on one side for you.  I saw her do it.  It depends on yourself
0x0420A6DD
to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is
0xB8AD06C6
the problem I study.  Kneel again on the rug."
0x4CF19EA3

0xDB06C2B2
"Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me."
0x847AC8B8

0xDB06C2B2
{She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair:
0x0E605B6E
p190.jpg}
0x3BAA57E4

0xDB06C2B2
I knelt.  She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
0x00EA8D6D
her chair.  She began muttering,--
0xE96DA4E0

0xDB06C2B2
"The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
0xD3A66E98
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
0xA5BCDE72
impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
0x1EB63CA6
to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
0xBE511626
signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.  It turns from me; it
0x6AF5B0C9
will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance,
0xA7E59A5E
the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge
0xB4AE6094
both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in
0xB13EB349
my opinion.  The eye is favourable.
0xCCAABAF3

0xDB06C2B2
"As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
0xC8F3E1A7
impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent
0xB5099B4A
on much the heart experiences.  Mobile and flexible, it was never
0x9431AB79
intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
0xBC2FF974
mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
0xC2A803A3
for its interlocutor.  That feature too is propitious.
0xB502C41C

0xDB06C2B2
"I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
0x2E6F3BB4
professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
0x0CCEB894
require me so to do.  I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.  I have an
0x3972B8B9
inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
0x1D5FF135
delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
0x6E62B47A
to give.'  The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
0x5BBA9B66
and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
0x3F114E7C
chasms.  The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
0xBD9B2D95
are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
0x0F570AB3
shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in
0x7153D70E
every decision.  Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but
0xF51347FF
I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the
0x468EDCA0
dictates of conscience.'
0xA314A38F

0xDB06C2B2
"Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.  I have formed
0x2850C641
my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have attended to the
0xE4183082
claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.  I know how soon youth
0xAFBA32B9
would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
0xE568DC0E
dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want
0xCC81654E
sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is not my taste.  I wish to foster,
0xD7FF74E6
not to blight--to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of
0x29DB8958
brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet--That will
0x3B5D246F
do.  I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.  I should wish now
0xB2420D56
to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare not.  So far I have
0xEE6F95CB
governed myself thoroughly.  I have acted as I inwardly swore I would
0xBD187BAF
act; but further might try me beyond my strength.  Rise, Miss Eyre: leave
0x5442B42A
me; the play is played out'."
0x506A35EB

0xDB06C2B2
Where was I?  Did I wake or sleep?  Had I been dreaming?  Did I dream
0x6052BC9E
still?  The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
0xD8866FD5
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my
0x9299AD11
own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I stirred the fire, and
0x30C1FB99
I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her
0x7E8897F8
face, and again beckoned me to depart.  The flame illuminated her hand
0xF8E1779E
stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once
0x62BD8D79
noticed that hand.  It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own;
0x3E70D50E
it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
0xB9632A73
turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
0x13D1FC4F
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.  Again I
0xFC26D88C
looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary,
0x20DC5984
the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.
0x278D2710

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.
0x5B921E44

0xDB06C2B2
"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--"
0x679A91E2

0xDB06C2B2
"But the string is in a knot--help me."
0x91E334A4

0xDB06C2B2
"Break it, sir."
0x5570D0ED

0xDB06C2B2
"There, then--'Off, ye lendings!'"  And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
0x2C7C7D0A
disguise.
0x3FE29516

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, sir, what a strange idea!"
0x79C778A6

0xDB06C2B2
"But well carried out, eh?  Don't you think so?"
0x0D44590E

0xDB06C2B2
"With the ladies you must have managed well."
0x33723846

0xDB06C2B2
"But not with you?"
0x981AF13E

0xDB06C2B2
"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
0x79E47791

0xDB06C2B2
"What character did I act?  My own?"
0x57172DE5

0xDB06C2B2
"No; some unaccountable one.  In short, I believe you have been trying to
0x0B4C1103
draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
0x0195EE9C
nonsense.  It is scarcely fair, sir."
0x61E1FD79

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you forgive me, Jane?"
0xD0D98449

0xDB06C2B2
"I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.  If, on reflection, I
0x898206C2
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
0x53EDA366
but it was not right."
0x252C310F

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible."
0xDF01C180

0xDB06C2B2
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.  It was a comfort; but,
0xFEFF5DEE
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
0x9B978461
interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and
0xC1D3EBEF
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
0xE7B2E687
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
0x11C37B1D
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
0xF811714A
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
0x8148B1D8
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
0x92D3FD6A

0xDB06C2B2
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
0xE358AE41
signify?"
0x9C03EEA9

0xDB06C2B2
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
0x91D4E99E
now, I suppose?"
0x32B7C58B

0xDB06C2B2
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
0x856957BE
yonder are doing."
0xD5DC29F5

0xDB06C2B2
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
0xDC1DD055

0xDB06C2B2
"Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me."
0x3710D52D

0xDB06C2B2
"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
0x502D51ED
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
0x46B7B7A9
left this morning?"
0xD3631B93

0xDB06C2B2
"A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?"
0x89CBA4BC

0xDB06C2B2
"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of
0x87DD1574
installing himself here till you returned."
0x1707B45D

0xDB06C2B2
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
0x94DD2C33

0xDB06C2B2
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
0x6727EB71
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
0xF99185E9

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
0xDFA6D655
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
0x866531C5
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
0x3C191D62

0xDB06C2B2
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
0x2F027CF0
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
0x21530A3D
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
0x8AC21FF6
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
0x60BDABCD
seemed to know what he was doing.
0x1D75D3DF

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
0xAA86BAA8

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
0x0961D0CA

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
0xE69FAD5F

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
0x5E4CC366

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
0xE987CB8D

0xDB06C2B2
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
0xB87AE4C4
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
0x47598F96
and dreary look.
0x7E4A89DD

0xDB06C2B2
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
0xEAF43D35
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
0xD877B6BB

0xDB06C2B2
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
0xCC0B9927

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
0xB90009C2

0xDB06C2B2
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
0xBF601CB0

0xDB06C2B2
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
0xF90D2E38
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
0x5798558E
doing."
0x9F5C9EFC

0xDB06C2B2
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
0x1C943258
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
0x125D027A
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
0x987FEB3E
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
0xACFC71FF
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
0x21250291
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
0x309DE825
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
0x45D8DD20
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
0xAB69F338
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
0x109E16F0

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
0x0ECB53D0
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
0x684F217D

0xDB06C2B2
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
0xF3A62768
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
0xE8611F5B

0xDB06C2B2
"Laughing and talking, sir."
0xDE759123

0xDB06C2B2
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
0x958CACF5
strange?"
0xA198DAA4

0xDB06C2B2
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
0x3A9D2604

0xDB06C2B2
"And Mason?"
0xF96823F3

0xDB06C2B2
"He was laughing too."
0x1FDA7F64

0xDB06C2B2
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
0xBA9FD702
Jane?"
0x57F73931

0xDB06C2B2
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
0xB8020B06

0xDB06C2B2
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
0x5ABF2414
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
0x394CFE88
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
0xAF932FA9

0xDB06C2B2
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
0x326C1AFC
you."
0xEED23204

0xDB06C2B2
"To comfort me?"
0x544DEE9F

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
0xCD20BA3F

0xDB06C2B2
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
0xB06F111F

0xDB06C2B2
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
0x53EB7C38
care nothing about it."
0x45E74D10

0xDB06C2B2
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
0x963BC55C

0xDB06C2B2
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
0x1A7A5B5A
you, I am sure, do."
0x402BB6DC

0xDB06C2B2
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
0x3F441AA9
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
0x5C2B7E56
and then leave me."
0x3629A4E6

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
0x129888A9
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
0x99D027D5
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
0x56A4BB80

0xDB06C2B2
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
0x3012A67B
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
0x26598E87
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
0x406B8EDE

0xDB06C2B2
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
0xE6A3BD91
asleep.
0xFD87ADDF

0xDB06C2B2
CHAPTER XX
0x20BAD970

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
0x9E72EA2F
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
0x284F8672
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
0xF7BFEB37
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
0x94DEBBE1
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
0x0B180F4D
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
0x8528AC00
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
0xC0A788B0
the curtain.
0xC966BB39

0xDB06C2B2
Good God!  What a cry!
0xBA5B0497

0xDB06C2B2
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
0x641649A0
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
0xBF74E849

0xDB06C2B2
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
0xECE7CF72
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
0xE582CFF5
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
0xEC06FFCD
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
0x6A9B7203
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
0x42A7D3B5
it could repeat the effort.
0xE5D8961B

0xDB06C2B2
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
0x68A50A8F
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
0xBF9141AE
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
0x8D99B81F
voice shouted--
0x272C62B8

0xDB06C2B2
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
0x45040C3B

0xDB06C2B2
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
0xA48A243E
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
0x0D5A56F0

0xDB06C2B2
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
0xE1526CBF

0xDB06C2B2
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
0x1A3DAAB2
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
0x4DEB8EC5
was silence.
0xEA5DD455

0xDB06C2B2
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
0xDBCBD068
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
0xA0634057
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
0x4030738A
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
0x413F6A83
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
0x7957FD92
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
0x1B422AA5
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
0xCE0A32F0
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
0x7FFA3915
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
0x9DD1A9B7
confusion was inextricable.
0xAB8CF9A5

0xDB06C2B2
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
0x062BDA0D
in his bed."
0x4FC46EED

0xDB06C2B2
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
0xC3DF295E
coming."
0xD8AC7FF4

0xDB06C2B2
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
0xCC9B3632
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
0x2890EA9C
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
0x70FF8655

0xDB06C2B2
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
0x490CB4B3
worst at once!"
0x1666CB86

0xDB06C2B2
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
0x0F488EDE
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
0xA93A82D4
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
0x675D18F7

0xDB06C2B2
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
0x89E8FADE
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
0x96FCD3EE

0xDB06C2B2
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
0xEBC19879
by an effort, he added--
0xA10F9DBB

0xDB06C2B2
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
0xEE46FC8B
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
0xC8E9E130
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
0x2E74D88C
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
0x4CDF4832
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
0x951CB804
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
0x7266A375
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
0x654C720B
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
0x977D6F87
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
0x6BF2DDEB

0xDB06C2B2
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
0x4D50CC23
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
0xD13FC007
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
0xE3F13BA6
had left it.
0x2307E504

0xDB06C2B2
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
0x65339410
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
0x160B0B30
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
0x5FE68A24
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
0x0D18F15B
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
0xFAF8A23C
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
0xE8AA4EA1
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
0x48BF2362
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
0xAC05915B
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
0x7057B5E3
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
0x15A0BAA2

0xDB06C2B2
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
0x6F02BC80
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
0xA972CA79
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
0xCC5C1B21
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
0x40B056CB
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
0x0A8D35BE
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
0x8222C1BD
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
0x35B90E4B

0xDB06C2B2
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
0x896A2CD8

0xDB06C2B2
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
0x7948115A

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"And dressed?"
0x68871025

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"Come out, then, quietly."
0x96F973FD

0xDB06C2B2
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
0xA3443461

0xDB06C2B2
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
0x55D582E3
noise."
0x77020C07

0xDB06C2B2
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
0x8E949CD3
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
0x320DB65D
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
0x0F046A96
side.
0x435D8D55

0xDB06C2B2
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
0xE9E9F4D9

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
0x9EC2109E

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"Go back and fetch both."
0xB635ADB3

0xDB06C2B2
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
0xDDF3C241
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
0xFB95A193
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
0x5F44B5A8
he paused, and addressed me again.
0xE1DBF6F4

0xDB06C2B2
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
0xF66E2C53

0xDB06C2B2
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
0xA0009179

0xDB06C2B2
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
0x93476E0C

0xDB06C2B2
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
0x87D6F441
fit."
0x07B39C1B

0xDB06C2B2
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
0x656A8157
the key and opened the door.
0x0C93C137

0xDB06C2B2
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
0xACD7ADF8
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
0x8F9EE72B
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
0x935B0207
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
0xC8BE64F5
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
0xEF7ED5B4
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
0x0610DEE6
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
0x0AE43BD5
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
0xCC05F4D7
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
0x2DF3862D
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
0x6D84A911
came out and closed the door behind him.
0x2522C78E

0xDB06C2B2
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
0x54A87034
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
0x7BC4068E
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
0x8F56247D
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
0xF275AB9B
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
0x785F198B
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
0x242BB9D3
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
0x0F156E90
blood.
0xF6D534E5

0xDB06C2B2
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
0x23810DB0
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
0xB133D84A
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
0x796BC75E
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
0x9C028AF0
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
0xD1A214C0
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
0xC97530F9
blood, trickling fast down.
0x5BA2E06F

0xDB06C2B2
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
0x67058ABE

0xDB06C2B2
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
0x34B22412
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
0xE702C5A8
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
0x6DAE7475

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir?"
0xF152E326

0xDB06C2B2
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
0x32075FB9
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
0x0BECC1DE
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
0x828CA776
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
0xA6573FE9
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
0x500DA6A8
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
0x9BFD8A0F
consequences."
0x4DC2E980

0xDB06C2B2
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
0xF019A29B
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
0xE55DDF62
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
0x6EECB882
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
0xC6A78C8F
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
0x1C2AB923
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
0x10B1C4D6
step ceased to be heard.
0xE20063B5

0xDB06C2B2
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
0xCCE05E0F
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
0xC0A9032B
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
0xA93497EE
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
0x80E02CA6
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
0x1E12ECEB

0xDB06C2B2
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
0x71164FC4
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
0xD7D6513A
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
0x12CE13BA
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
0x90A68D12
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
0x7B9F788D
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
0x7E97B085
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
0x9A1913D3
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
0xA26EDB5C
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
0x2C5991CE
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
0x6D9C9E3B
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
0xE75F7A51
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
0x747B4CC0

0xDB06C2B2
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
0x68E38C55
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
0xE52224DB
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
0x4F9B19ED
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
0x716ABFAA
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
0xFABB39AB
subordinate's form.
0xB25E73D7

0xDB06C2B2
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
0x3E9605D3
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
0x9A0DE173
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
0xE980C9CE
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
0xAE27D9C2
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
0x73B78795

0xDB06C2B2
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
0xAF3BEC01
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
0x1009B8CA
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
0x2E387E6E
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
0xDBFF907D
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
0xF6D05473
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
0xE11AB436

0xDB06C2B2
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
0x421B87D9
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
0x8C3AEC30
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
0x26B4E4B9
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
0xED164B75
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
0xF2075185
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
0xF591375A
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
0xB206661B
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
0x220E20A0
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
0x2A7F2D2E
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
0xE73249C7
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
0x8D390A6E
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
0xAB7BEC28
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
0x6FFF1D15
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
0x97DC8B93
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
0xABECB7F5
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
0x9194CEA9
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
0x684E83B4
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
0x22C7FDD6
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
0x631DF150

0xDB06C2B2
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
0x0CDBA6F8
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
0x18A75BBE
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
0x7A57E8B8
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
0x51827E87
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
0x2CD4FDAD

0xDB06C2B2
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
0xE4C97226
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
0x07E42843
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
0xD63B4416
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
0xA63E582D
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
0xF7D67DC5
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
0x7FB1D883
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
0xEA3BDDB3
I might not even speak to him.
0x673BF5B1

0xDB06C2B2
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
0x1FEE06A9
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
0xF45919E5
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
0x6F506E38
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
0xDFA3EBE3
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
0x2935FEA8
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
0x98B99658
shorter.
0x3A3E7B62

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
0x2AC40D42

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
0x20601C9F
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
0xEFCA6756
patient downstairs and all."
0xB04098C6

0xDB06C2B2
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
0x5FE06647

0xDB06C2B2
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
0x8651B27A
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
0x51117B6E

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
0x4302483A
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
0x17AB26EE
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
0x12E4AABA
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
0x88433A92

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
0x10313EA4

0xDB06C2B2
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
0xE8FDBB14

0xDB06C2B2
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
0x9D728F1F
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
0x491A9CB7
there's no danger."
0xDA28C060

0xDB06C2B2
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
0x3B013CEE
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
0xDDF5E547
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
0x26B78D4F
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
0x691DFD86
here!"
0xA92E056D

0xDB06C2B2
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
0xEDEC2F36
Rochester got the knife from her."
0x37517D16

0xDB06C2B2
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
0x3D92B970
said Mr. Rochester.
0x50D96449

0xDB06C2B2
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
0xCADDCE99
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
0x1B9972E9
looked so quiet at first."
0xACC18388

0xDB06C2B2
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
0x8BDD6A84
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
0x53B810A4
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
0xC68EDE9E
alone."
0x62CB6044

0xDB06C2B2
"I thought I could have done some good."
0x8117B43A

0xDB06C2B2
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
0xA6B36300
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
0xBA7B591B
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
0xD7218649
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
0x355A9C73

0xDB06C2B2
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
0x47DF103A
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
0x441A4C71

0xDB06C2B2
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
0xF765F51D

0xDB06C2B2
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
0xCA03E6DF
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
0xC1198200
said--
0xF0D0D532

0xDB06C2B2
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
0x6BCA5E2B
it."
0xFECF2790

0xDB06C2B2
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
0x2A2123D6

0xDB06C2B2
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
0x8F1445B2
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
0x6A91E864
think of her at all."
0xDE252652

0xDB06C2B2
"Impossible to forget this night!"
0xD7063552

0xDB06C2B2
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
0x1D6F27A8
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
0x4FB84D54
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
0xC3ED6FDB
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
0x523EC8B8
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
0x8CA6DB75
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
0xC2F47CE3
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
0x7F5DA3A9

0xDB06C2B2
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
0x90EA4886
and returned with them.
0x263BD515

0xDB06C2B2
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
0x777AC7B6
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
0xC1CF514F

0xDB06C2B2
I retired as directed.
0xB35AE59E

0xDB06C2B2
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
0x7EC7C5E6
Rochester presently.
0x1021A21E

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir; all was very still."
0x19AF53B4

0xDB06C2B2
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
0x3ED4AD95
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
0x966E6372
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
0x29026AD1
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
0x052C230B
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
0xFB6B0270
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
0x8F1ABA5C
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
0x8D9E079D

0xDB06C2B2
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
0x2A3D266E
edged with fur.
0x4510201F

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
0xE4AAB0FC
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
0x7E680258
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
0xAE5CF2FF
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
0x4622D2DD
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
0x95229736

0xDB06C2B2
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
0x0079BCE7

0xDB06C2B2
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
0xEB3B67FF
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
0x530A05A8
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
0x9633B687
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
0xE9C033B6
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
0xD8316A38

0xDB06C2B2
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
0x757CE754
the washstand.
0x06DDCA33

0xDB06C2B2
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
0xAFAAD3FC

0xDB06C2B2
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
0x5811125C
to Mason.
0x5EE513D8

0xDB06C2B2
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
0x8B7C4F2C

0xDB06C2B2
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
0x850D7B3E

0xDB06C2B2
"Drink! drink! drink!"
0x9E8828A8

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
0x6552A863
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
0x614EDA36
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
0x078960BA
liquid; he then took his arm--
0x8261E8DC

0xDB06C2B2
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
0x5D3B572A

0xDB06C2B2
The patient rose.
0x9EAB04E8

0xDB06C2B2
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
0x17B3B16E
step out--that's it!"
0xD7B1E606

0xDB06C2B2
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
0x1DFF6DEF

0xDB06C2B2
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
0xB7B30406
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
0xBEE56E0D
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
0xB81533DE
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
0x474B405D
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
0x0DA26B35

0xDB06C2B2
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
0x20979F7A
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
0xC0DFA46B
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
0x7965DB54
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
0x39A261C6
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
0x8AB93359
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
0xFC278920
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
0x2FE23E51
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
0x9FD061E5
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
0x0FF0E3CC
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
0xBE358431
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
0xD4F6DF2A
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
0x2ECC4332

0xDB06C2B2
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
0x73FD106E
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
0xF8F752BA
chaise; Carter followed.
0x0368327E

0xDB06C2B2
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
0x9C7208EA
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
0x369A5655
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
0xD2856C7F

0xDB06C2B2
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
0x4E744A9D

0xDB06C2B2
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
0x46EA404D
Dick."
0xEA4BE5FA

0xDB06C2B2
"Fairfax--"
0x0F8B28E3

0xDB06C2B2
"Well what is it?"
0x03D964EC

0xDB06C2B2
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
0xAAB62031
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
0xEE55D0BA

0xDB06C2B2
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
0xCC3381CA
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
0x6EB2DF9A

0xDB06C2B2
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
0xA5BC10B6
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
0x19A5BD29

0xDB06C2B2
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
0xD23347FE
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
0x99129820
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
0xE6CEF007
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
0xB8131DAC

0xDB06C2B2
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
0x2D267B26
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
0xB5932DB2

0xDB06C2B2
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
0x951EAFA1

0xDB06C2B2
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
0x66DFCAD8
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
0xC9DF0CAD
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
0xBDB789A2
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
0xC7B4D3B7
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
0x76D9916C
pure."
0xB0F251E0

0xDB06C2B2
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
0xC0F14B6C
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
0x7B46EDF1
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
0xF6B6FD6C
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
0x9AD5A05D
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
0x91328664
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
0x69A4551C
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
0x7A357E97
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
0x49228C6D

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
0x64006039

0xDB06C2B2
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
0x57E75259
me.
0x23A34F09

0xDB06C2B2
"Thank you, sir."
0xE943749B

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
0x82132A67
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
0x7EA1D7E2
atmosphere?"
0x6720E31D

0xDB06C2B2
"I do, very much."
0x1F0AB97E

0xDB06C2B2
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
0x5BD04223

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
0x659AF518
with Mason?"
0xE838D501

0xDB06C2B2
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
0x9BFB7F0B

0xDB06C2B2
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
0xFD40C2B4
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
0x39F74E6B
wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
0xF686B0BD

0xDB06C2B2
"Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"
0x184B822C

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your
0x8D5A281D
thoughts."
0x25ED6894

0xDB06C2B2
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."
0x6BC81265

0xDB06C2B2
"Never fear--I will take care of myself."
0xE57B38E8

0xDB06C2B2
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
0xD30C6FCB

0xDB06C2B2
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
0xBB723EF4
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
0xB4D7CB45
spue fire any day."
0xC085A822

0xDB06C2B2
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
0x57448697
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure
0xCFE1121F
you."
0xEED23204

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, no!  Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me--but,
0xB01E7F4A
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
0x43BF755D
if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."
0x17F89BBC

0xDB06C2B2
"Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
0x47C6CC13
how to avert the danger."
0x9D147CA8

0xDB06C2B2
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
0x961A42FB
from him.
0xA75BDA84

0xDB06C2B2
"If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?  Annihilated
0x8CEFCE57
in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
0x5BD38BF4
him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
0x46FF7F4F
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
0x2ECA8AEF
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.
0x15543C27
Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little
0x25F6AA74
friend, are you not?"
0x6BB6BB70

0xDB06C2B2
"I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."
0x06814087

0xDB06C2B2
"Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and
0x1468E6B7
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
0xB1520C2F
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
0xBD191CD2
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
0xDE6FCAC7
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
0xB0C3E6E9
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
0x8FA7E2A8
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
0x46CC22C6
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
0x087A89B3
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
0x71E76600
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
0xD222C7E6
me at once."
0xBCBE15B9

0xDB06C2B2
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
0xF61B09FE
you are very safe."
0xB0B87CE6

0xDB06C2B2
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
0x56CD030C

0xDB06C2B2
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
0x8468D4C2
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
0xBC6BA650
before him.
0x1E470F19

0xDB06C2B2
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
0xCC2B34A8
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
0x599DE13A

0xDB06C2B2
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
0x0B1D4FE4

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
0x8CD6A3A1
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
0x35F476AE
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
0x85C96BA5
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
0x3A354B89
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
0x7E1FFFE0
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
0xD6DD89FD

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir; I am content."
0x69C8575D

0xDB06C2B2
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
0xB60C41FF
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
0x2CFAD70C
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
0x4D0EBE3A
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
0x18F34AA4
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
0x1D69F6A4
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
0x391C3E77
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
0x08577E34
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
0xECE5497B
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
0xA37E5C1D
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
0x6C5D9397
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
0x01503EAF
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
0xD59DED56
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
0x43745DD5
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
0x1B0BAD9F
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
0x1A1D475A
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
0x72BE4EAA
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
0x89E53628
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
0xF56C4F7C
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
0xD90DB907
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
0x578192E1
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
0xDFFE9926
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
0x0A043AAD
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
0x605AB2D6
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
0x84B160E8
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
0x5FE4FA20
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
0x17647A8E
judgment approves?"
0x947A3D3B

0xDB06C2B2
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
0x611A3649
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
0x1AF618BD
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
0x90D098F8
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
0xDA3AF47C
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
0xD078C3D2

0xDB06C2B2
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
0xF10BA7E2

0xDB06C2B2
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
0xDCDE00A9
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
0x52A81B97
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
0x0AC8345B
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
0xC6A7F2A5

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
0x18624DC2
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
0xBCEE3FB0
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
0xA0713CCA
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
0xC3C613CB
amend and solace to heal."
0x58275EF0

0xDB06C2B2
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
0x25BB15CD
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
0xA0B20EE9
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the
0x46866470
instrument for my cure in--"
0xE2A83CA2

0xDB06C2B2
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
0x9EE7D176
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
0x5C122291
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
0x3DF77C80
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
0x7809DB78
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
0xFF284F16

0xDB06C2B2
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
0x88D32942
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
0x6CC8C9C4
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
0x4FC3F4BA
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
0xFB844990

0xDB06C2B2
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
0xF5699861
came back he was humming a tune.
0xD088E15F

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
0xCFEB53E4
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
0x52844C90

0xDB06C2B2
"Curse you?  No, sir."
0x3DA45DC2

0xDB06C2B2
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
0x30C33E86
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
0xCDF126AD
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
0x949E780C

0xDB06C2B2
"Whenever I can be useful, sir."
0x805980FC

0xDB06C2B2
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
0x8900F39E
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
0xA714CA9E
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
0x1E05EEDE

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
0x1462DF6D

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
0x76F029EB
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
0xBB34D61F
Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."
0x61C72F9B

0xDB06C2B2
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
0x0462770B
cheerfully--
0x612D27D9

0xDB06C2B2
"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:
0xDD20B503
I rose at four to see him off."
0x9A6996B3

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
CHAPTER XXI
0x8C6A8D55

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
0x200CA9C6
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
0x88F822A6
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
0x7D21AF34
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
0xF6877006
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
0x71950C0F
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
0x7E2E2469
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
0x9C1867B5
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
0x837AD425
man.
0x86A0AF37

0xDB06C2B2
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
0x5E321C44
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
0xB85FEF01
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
0x703EDE91
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
0xC1F860FB
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
0xD683E117
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
0x4C63255C
little sister.
0x420EBFDC

0xDB06C2B2
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
0xD4FEB9B1
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
0x25EB5A53
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
0x3356E5C0
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
0xF3C76818
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
0x6BDEAAE4
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
0x866B87D7
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
0x5477DCC2
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
0xA3C1DD36
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
0xEF695B2C

0xDB06C2B2
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
0x3E064E31
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
0xEA4848B1
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
0x5EE70F98
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
0x8A9A171B
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
0x88347167
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
0xF9F535A7
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
0x508BB249
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
0x39CF80DC
was surrounded with a crape band.
0x0E5F9BEA

0xDB06C2B2
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
0xA3AB2FD4
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
0x4F3BA388
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."
0x476CE659

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
0x2FD6F396
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
0x6C7E1DBB
are married to Bessie?"
0xB6072383

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
0xBA2AEE09
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
0xC1241694
child are thriving."
0x4842C155

0xDB06C2B2
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
0x03545C11

0xDB06C2B2
"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
0x38BEDC91
badly at present--in great trouble."
0x5C229D6A

0xDB06C2B2
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
0xC878A3D9
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
0xB637555E

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."
0xC8A53E76

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. John?"
0x5ED3FBBC

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"And how does his mother bear it?"
0x0D08F986

0xDB06C2B2
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
0x7079B48C
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
0xBFC8ECC3
his death was shocking."
0x4B93080B

0xDB06C2B2
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
0x987EB60C

0xDB06C2B2
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
0x08E5CDF3
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
0xFFA5A862
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
0xE0B4CF62
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
0x62452F6C
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
0xBC686640
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
0xA9437ADF
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
0x5ABEC683
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
0x470FC583
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
0x08A3C257

0xDB06C2B2
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
0x1D798A99

0xDB06C2B2
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
0xBFC0AC3F
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
0x29A91C09
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
0x21F8C90A
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
0x1C4F14A5
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
0x24879EFA
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
0xEA70DD61
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
0x81423DE9
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
0x83C2C25E
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
0x829217CF
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
0x12D0028D
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
0xD4A126E9
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
0x2FA80708
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
0x9E703979
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
0xAF3DE0E9
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
0x2689C291
morning."
0x553D4586

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
0xA4F6B716

0xDB06C2B2
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
0x2D091C2E
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
0x04B6824F

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
0x8BA605D8
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
0x1A8F2EEF
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
0x77C2281F

0xDB06C2B2
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
0x3A535F7B
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
0x30FE0A7E
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
0xD90E5B6B
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
0x90EAA1DF
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
0xA5AF3B92
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
0x05847016
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
0xA89A7FD8
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
0xA800DE51
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
0x5306F465
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
0x3D2982E7
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
0xD3DB3D9A
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
0xAAEC668A
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
0xDB05CF01
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
0xA66C858D
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
0x4FEDFAB1
lineaments.
0x268FF269

0xDB06C2B2
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
0x9C0ED5B3
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
0x39067D1C
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
0x5556F31E
cue and followed me from the room.
0x3512D032

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
0xA343F81E
which he had shut.
0x1836C921

0xDB06C2B2
"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."
0xD8DCB02F

0xDB06C2B2
"What to do?--where to go?"
0x7631CE22

0xDB06C2B2
"To see a sick lady who has sent for me."
0x35DA6ED3

0xDB06C2B2
"What sick lady?--where does she live?"
0x45DC82A9

0xDB06C2B2
"At Gateshead; in ---shire."
0x9C6FFA81

0xDB06C2B2
"-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for
0xF28D250D
people to see her that distance?"
0x9D35C153

0xDB06C2B2
"Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed."
0xBEDBB497

0xDB06C2B2
"Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate."
0x8F57C79B

0xDB06C2B2
"It is his widow, sir."
0x0DF676DA

0xDB06C2B2
"And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?"
0xFDF33053

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother."
0x2B5D80EC

0xDB06C2B2
"The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you
0x000C8BCD
had no relations."
0xF74D00BF

0xDB06C2B2
"None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
0x5404BEE2
off."
0xE32E79FE

0xDB06C2B2
"Why?"
0x899CA234

0xDB06C2B2
"Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me."
0x3C5A08B7

0xDB06C2B2
"But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was
0xD130D7F7
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
0x2E71BB47
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
0x54A2A1FE
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
0xAD7021FF
in London."
0xD94BCFED

0xDB06C2B2
"John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
0x422BB4F2
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked
0x70460DA4
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack."
0xE164BB37

0xDB06C2B2
"And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of
0xB1906D9C
running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
0x721678F1
before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off."
0x4C9ED00B

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
0xB46FAA2F
different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now."
0xD67D9811

0xDB06C2B2
"How long will you stay?"
0x6C3A770E

0xDB06C2B2
"As short a time as possible, sir."
0xC75DB2D0

0xDB06C2B2
"Promise me only to stay a week--"
0x514E65BB

0xDB06C2B2
"I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it."
0x86FB9057

0xDB06C2B2
"At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any
0x5AA1A071
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?"
0xC59ED73F

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well."
0xEC558C6D

0xDB06C2B2
"And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone."
0x0673FA9F

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir, she has sent her coachman."
0x1D958754

0xDB06C2B2
"A person to be trusted?"
0x666DDB06

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family."
0x5AC83E88

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester meditated.  "When do you wish to go?"
0x86AC6A55

0xDB06C2B2
"Early to-morrow morning, sir."
0x2FB0487F

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I
0xD9EC14E3
daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have
0x6D4122CC
you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.
0xF76749A4

0xDB06C2B2
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  "Five shillings, sir."  He
0x8B429270
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
0x8FB7A32C
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"
0x59577F09
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
0x48C853E3
fifteen.  I told him I had no change.
0xDCDDDF53

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages."
0xE5B4F8F6

0xDB06C2B2
I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as
0x5FD8062F
if recollecting something, he said--
0x1559722A

0xDB06C2B2
"Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
0x58725480
away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not
0x45688DF8
plenty?"
0x1138918B

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir, but now you owe me five."
0xA298D877

0xDB06C2B2
"Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds."
0x5019A7ED

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
0x8723566A
while I have the opportunity."
0xDA31B00B

0xDB06C2B2
"Matter of business?  I am curious to hear it."
0x05C911F2

0xDB06C2B2
"You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
0x0FC6534F
married?"
0xD3470628

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; what then?"
0x0DEADD36

0xDB06C2B2
"In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will
0xF974DAD5
perceive the necessity of it."
0xC64ADACB

0xDB06C2B2
"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her
0xFC48ADF9
rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of
0xEF5B482D
it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march
0xF2A84BCD
straight to--the devil?"
0xF71C28A7

0xDB06C2B2
"I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere."
0x03F2B88C

0xDB06C2B2
"In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
0x61758CEF
features equally fantastic and ludicrous.  He looked at me some minutes.
0x3DDB9616

0xDB06C2B2
"And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
0x453C5B48
you to seek a place, I suppose?"
0x14CF7E30

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in
0x0F58D1C8
asking favours of them--but I shall advertise."
0xAB5A81B1

0xDB06C2B2
"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled.  "At your peril
0xA81EDBD7
you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
0x0EF41727
pounds.  Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it."
0x7C87F4D0

0xDB06C2B2
"And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
0xF4886E05
me.  "I could not spare the money on any account."
0xD04B5EB2

0xDB06C2B2
"Little niggard!" said he, "refusing me a pecuniary request!  Give me
0x2FD9C08E
five pounds, Jane."
0x58060BEC

0xDB06C2B2
"Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence."
0x625E4866

0xDB06C2B2
"Just let me look at the cash."
0xFD3CA53F

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir; you are not to be trusted."
0xEA5AA722

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane!"
0x331CD95B

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir?"
0xF152E326

0xDB06C2B2
"Promise me one thing."
0x34567460

0xDB06C2B2
"I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform."
0x4CA13306

0xDB06C2B2
"Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.  I'll
0xFC90EDF6
find you one in time."
0x1E41E21D

0xDB06C2B2
"I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I
0xE5FD9FB7
and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters
0x349BA338
it."
0xFECF2790

0xDB06C2B2
"Very well! very well!  I'll pledge my word on it.  You go to-morrow,
0xAFDDB15F
then?"
0x420CFF6F

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir; early."
0xE6B2E3BD

0xDB06C2B2
"Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?"
0x8C3D690B

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir, I must prepare for the journey."
0x13BAA227

0xDB06C2B2
"Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?"
0x4D87B2AD

0xDB06C2B2
"I suppose so, sir."
0x93578823

0xDB06C2B2
"And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm
0x2C2CB545
not quite up to it."
0x38ABAF91

0xDB06C2B2
"They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer."
0xE2EA8916

0xDB06C2B2
"Then say it."
0xB6DB8FF0

0xDB06C2B2
"Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present."
0x6F2EF8F5

0xDB06C2B2
"What must I say?"
0x4C03F94A

0xDB06C2B2
"The same, if you like, sir."
0xB34A9248

0xDB06C2B2
"Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?"
0xA5BC97F9

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes?"
0xFCC66467

0xDB06C2B2
"It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like
0xC4D0FB62
something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for
0x7B979CF3
instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more
0x039E6009
than say Farewell, Jane?"
0xEBE03021

0xDB06C2B2
"It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word
0x22239449
as in many."
0x82CB2865

0xDB06C2B2
"Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'"
0x7A81D9FD

0xDB06C2B2
"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked
0x36C12044
myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
0xA3BF90B5
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
0x80CBFC66
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
0x1E8E54D2

0xDB06C2B2
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
0xB6C492F8
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
0xB2535B62
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
0xEE9709A8
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
0x9121B4C6
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
0xB2FCCA2A
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
0xE032233E

0xDB06C2B2
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
0x6D7DE3BE

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
0x05566167
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
0x53AF38EC

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
0xFA7EDA1E
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
0xC32356F0
will finally recover."
0x3C28AD76

0xDB06C2B2
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
0x8C5EB15A

0xDB06C2B2
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
0xAC11E3E0
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
0x6A438AA4
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
0xF403C81F
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
0x1710A023
and then I will go up with you?"
0xC1E94300

0xDB06C2B2
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
0x369D5DCC
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
0xB76432DE
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
0x404768D9
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
0xE5581BF2
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
0x79577B2B

0xDB06C2B2
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
0xD0A75064
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
0x9E183759
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
0x2BDC2A4B
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
0x16C97A73
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
0x95BAB339
looks.
0xC41DC9D7

0xDB06C2B2
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
0x6ED3BDDE
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
0x10CAA1A4
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
0x5E125490
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
0xD36C452B
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
0x20889880
obeyed her as in bygone days.
0x98D1F8B5

0xDB06C2B2
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
0x827AE374
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
0x042D1438
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
0xD56E2D8C
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
0xE1EE27C3
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
0x4C76FE73
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
0x6B1238BE
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
0x744D4356

0xDB06C2B2
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
0x69214A48
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
0x4B72F4CA
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
0x0B935703
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
0x2BB98ED8
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
0xD405D3E2
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
0xDC153CC1
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
0x6075AA88
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
0x9942CF4B
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
0x8E9211D2
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
0xBE2D0D27
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
0xD6C0C5BB
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
0xB66952E0

0xDB06C2B2
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
0xA6AC9551
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
0x63B7FFC1

0xDB06C2B2
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
0x8F62726A
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
0xF3652CC6
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
0x79CEB2FD
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
0x9A5AB776
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
0x05606059
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
0x535F930A
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
0xFE76B3CB
past recognition.
0x7D123189

0xDB06C2B2
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
0xE0A1E1B7
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
0x637B4E18
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
0xE973CF28
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
0x0B710D48
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
0x0B08BE43
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
0xB5BF15DC
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
0x4BDBDF45
colourless visage.
0xF62F1BC2

0xDB06C2B2
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
0x8186224C
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
0x4350988B
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
0x98872657
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
0xD512570B
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
0x03E8A5B6
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
0x0E67F8B5
other's looked puritanical.
0xFD8A257D

0xDB06C2B2
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
0xD4B478EF
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
0xA0E1EF7D
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
0x9050C2F5
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
0x05FA6290
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
0x77B6084B

0xDB06C2B2
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
0xF139005A
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
0x3D9A90A4
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
0x98767DF9
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
0xEB3B3AE9
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
0xBE4703F4
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
0x2A655CD2
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
0xCC838D68
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
0x015EA01C
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
0xD532A9C3
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
0x106EBD52
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
0x8E1D5CC4
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
0xF851C61B
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
0xBE3EF3AC

0xDB06C2B2
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
0xD2777280
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
0x74E521DA
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
0x4FA42EA5
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
0xDE37DCA2
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
0x01D7D1BF
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
0x60164FAB
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
0x88CF6DAF
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
0x53B95560
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
0xD5F377BC

0xDB06C2B2
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
0x02ADD0DF
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
0x0A4527E1
liberty.
0x5A2BCD5B

0xDB06C2B2
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
0x7E862A9D
can see her to-night."
0xCFA3298E

0xDB06C2B2
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
0x2A85BBB1
should be much obliged to you."
0xA5E6A84F

0xDB06C2B2
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
0xF9F426BB
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
0x26BE3309
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
0x507D591F

0xDB06C2B2
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
0xE8A798DD
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
0xB1C7AE6A
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
0x543E8610
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
0x75286190
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
0xC7570DB5
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
0x4E9530A3
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
0x6DBEB96A
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
0xE90DCC53
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
0x624C0A74
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
0x0D773A79
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
0x16B91FD2
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
0x8349CCC4
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
0xD577A113
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
0x8ABC3AB3
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
0x3CB7F91F

0xDB06C2B2
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
0x5DFEFCE7
us see if she will know you."
0xD2E87C37

0xDB06C2B2
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
0xF1C8651C
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
0xDC762946
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
0xE586B86C
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
0x90456FCF
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
0x61C32865
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
0x334D440B
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
0x1C44E62E
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
0x460EFAF6
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
0x44A0F38D
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
0x200B97F6
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
0xDD122D16

0xDB06C2B2
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
0xEBDC7A4C
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
0xCAA4320E
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
0x4E658AD9
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
0x3B998572
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
0x7A642B49
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
0xC2F0A438
amity.
0x1C371211

0xDB06C2B2
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
0xD5E3259D
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
0x85EB1AF0
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
0x52DD2959
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
0xBF1C2037
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
0x277321ED
she looked at me.
0xA5E60C45

0xDB06C2B2
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
0x9E998192

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
0xF636D972

0xDB06C2B2
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
0x17E14EE6
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
0xE3A292D3
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
0x89B017CF
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
0xCEB4D5BF
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
0x0F1D7017
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
0x0B05AAAD
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
0x43CDA7BF
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
0x1AC5FC13
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
0x07D90821
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
0xA3D7DBD3
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
0x561020FE
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
0xB13C90F3

0xDB06C2B2
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
0x2D42A68B
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
0x2028265E
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
0xBC341030
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
0xDE28A112
the pillow.
0xEE54C263

0xDB06C2B2
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
0x9FBFA63C
till I see how you get on."
0xB7FE2250

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
0xBC2634BD

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
0x89EEAFDA
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
0x7B7187B6
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
0xF5AB8FA7
say--let me see--"
0xE3A1AD52

0xDB06C2B2
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
0x06469991
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
0x6938479F
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
0x43D8C8CE
was at once irritated.
0x0DE5D193

0xDB06C2B2
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
0xBB8C96AC
you Jane Eyre?"
0x7DAFF9EB

0xDB06C2B2
"I am Jane Eyre."
0xCCFE3A66

0xDB06C2B2
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
0x471CDB51
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
0x6B79A0F3
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
0x451E7F97
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
0xBF3F0EE3
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
0x2F37E5AD
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
0xA98D8F23
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
0x2B7F5ABA
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
0xD1B7C312
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
0x0BEF92CB

0xDB06C2B2
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
0x272DBEBF

0xDB06C2B2
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
0x45D67B77
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
0xB0E572CE
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
0xD7B6638A
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
0x5E45F3AB
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
0x93741C50
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
0xB453C2F1
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
0x71632FAA
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
0x32834EAB
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
0x0655470C
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
0x67C87FB3
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
0x0970603A
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
0x7B9A0D97
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
0xB3C09AA0
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
0xDB25702F
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
0xD85E2811
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
0xC48E078D
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
0x751F7A1E
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
0x2239BECD
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
0xC14047D7
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
0x901C545E
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
0x8072EDF0
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
0xCEE97EAE
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
0x6E585D38
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
0xC9725B77

0xDB06C2B2
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
0x7DE4045B
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
0x78F0FA3A

0xDB06C2B2
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
0x4DDEE9C9
the morning she is calmer."
0x526086D4

0xDB06C2B2
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
0x264E92CC
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
0x3E67BB45
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
0x30819D5B
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
0xD67B65E6
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
0x80A8BBD1
had?"
0x1E49F597

0xDB06C2B2
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
0x20F25249
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
0x48B76286
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
0xBBF1A41F

0xDB06C2B2
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
0x3E1C6671
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
0x7E6CF242
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
0xCC443E97
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
0x0C74B6CA
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
0xBC49D4FE
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
0x1031C416
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
0x76035C5C
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
0xD4965939
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
0xE03E275D
for both.
0x08AED278

0xDB06C2B2
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
0x31077E96
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
0x4FA12C4E
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
0x9374BB8D
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
0x88438B74
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
0x0A5039DC
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
0x828C9CDD
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
0xDB408AFB
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
0xDE5AE389

0xDB06C2B2
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
0x174B2422
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
0xF6E0B2C4
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
0x2F0BC32D
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
0xCBC11C96
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
0x282444FB
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
0xA3627A2F
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
0x842764A3
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
0xF7F74957
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
0xC4985BB1
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
0xD34C3391
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
0xBAF3BD2B
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
0xD6299EBF
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
0xDD6E1E65
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
0x8A291F42
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
0xAC076AD3
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
0x559457E0
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
0x30D4F49E
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
0x6E2014C2
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
0x75166C79
and content.
0x28946C3B

0xDB06C2B2
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
0xFE33BAB2
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
0x093B831C
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
0x39B3B932
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
0xFD8B4F9B
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
0x1884ED18
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
0x6ED2050B
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
0x60987EE8
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
0xB756320F
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
0xFF503A3A
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
0x2661F53D
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
0x30570CFE
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
0x0C432026
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
0x413AFE53
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
0xEA7706C1
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
0xBFB9ABB4
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
0xEA680415
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
0x5C125121
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
0xF9DFF034
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
0x488C5C27
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
0x3AD68112
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
0x74663C85
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
0x4362423C
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
0x07E65CD6
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
0x64797CAA
mother's sick-room, and no more.
0x73A6CF68

0xDB06C2B2
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
0xA677F68E
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
0x87A6A4F3
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
0xE5508230
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
0x1035AA0C
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
0x640936B3
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
0xB9299A4B
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
0x30E0F42F
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
0xD4681046
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
0x3288CDBE
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
0x056336A6
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
0x52191264
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
0x26C461DA
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
0x2BD2F011
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
0x1C42516C
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
0x68F1DF34
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
0x8FA63A87
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
0xA6323B49
vary its clockwork regularity.
0x1BB6D305

0xDB06C2B2
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
0x6DA73C32
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
0xC3D93172
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
0xBD92BE67
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
0xABC33574
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
0x535C1502
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
0xDA709586
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
0x8D0198C5
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
0x6D164E7D
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
0x8F41F43D
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
0x053C9FAC

0xDB06C2B2
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
0x3E828D5A
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
0x31D3D823
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
0x9318E01C

0xDB06C2B2
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
0x74074938
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
0x1DA253CA
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
0x103E8B8E
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
0x8C7D0846
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
0x97ED3EE7
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
0xD3962F8D
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
0xDBC1BEC5
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
0x7D07DD8E
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
0x9D21066B
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
0x3CF98513
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
0x70176386

0xDB06C2B2
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
0x966F3862
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
0x1B9DD964
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
0x41AFE5EB
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
0x692DE89C
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
0xEED6DEF9
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
0x53A39232
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
0xD270B274
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
0x480181B4
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
0xA32DF183
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
0x7C359B01
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
0x450632F9
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
0x6182DB3C
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
0xA9BF88BA
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
0xA1BA6380
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
0x47220B9F
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
0x195D5DED
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
0x7354960A
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
0x3583D10D
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
0xD3BB20E7
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
0x35830144
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
0x2983719E
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
0x54C625DE
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
0x34CF7270
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
0xA962B403
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
0xC975633C
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
0xCCA83524
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
0xE6DEF604
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
0x41B79891
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
0x49E9CA32
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
0x03E7520B
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
0x85F97DB5
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
0xD8FB46F9

0xDB06C2B2
She closed her lips.
0x1F7C1EFA

0xDB06C2B2
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
0x39DD6695
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
0xCF77C714
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
0xE433053B
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
0xC2846324
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
0x59562BA2
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
0x95AF1B16
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
0xEDA6CE62
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
0x7D5A5EBB
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
0x1C63F48A

0xDB06C2B2
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
0xFC190B1B
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
0xFDBF1F6E
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
0xC9BEC032
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
0x35C800AA
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
0x13CEC87B

0xDB06C2B2
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
0x450D9116
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
0xA170BF35
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
0x4939C9FB
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
0x09FA3108
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
0xFFF40284
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
0x4D00F53D

0xDB06C2B2
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
0x0209AEB2
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
0x6E0FD587
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
0x8495D4D0
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
0x27C96BB3
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
0x0DAA2182
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
0x4BA808BC
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
0xB8488AC4
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
0x8C5F18BC
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
0xB5D177B7
me, and then I moved away to the window.
0x23AD81BC

0xDB06C2B2
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
0xD5687D2E
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
0xAF1709AD
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
0xFA7E9570
tenement--flit when at length released?"
0x34430557

0xDB06C2B2
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
0xD3C8DB06
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
0xC5C9EA21
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
0x9862800B
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
0x3EE13A67
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
0x7B4B7CCD
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
0xFDE7E225
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
0xE992569A

0xDB06C2B2
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
0x284839E4
her.
0x6FF88399

0xDB06C2B2
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
0x81E98B7D

0xDB06C2B2
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
0x5A78AFBB
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
0x92BC4E7F
me--where is Bessie?"
0xE8E741FA

0xDB06C2B2
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
0x8C88CF98

0xDB06C2B2
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
0xADE164B5
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
0x6A15654C
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
0xFD7C7AC4

0xDB06C2B2
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
0xBBC78E2B
identity.
0xC6121408

0xDB06C2B2
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
0xD71911FF
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
0x325146AC
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
0x2E88EDF8
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
0x54C303D1
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
0xDCF60CE9
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
0xB0E745C5

0xDB06C2B2
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
0x23CF8C50
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
0xE1F60620
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
0x1D2A8D3A
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
0xE5112D25
or is there no one in the room but you?"
0x6841B7BF

0xDB06C2B2
I assured her we were alone.
0x810E8CC1

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
0xD87DD3D6
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
0x1973C2BE
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
0x0413028B
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
0x8FC4E221
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
0x5D7BB8A7

0xDB06C2B2
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
0xD98CFB5B
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
0x93890480
of the last pang.
0x3088524C

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
0x2EB02B61
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
0x93C1F736
there."
0xB042A738

0xDB06C2B2
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
0x212E0D81

0xDB06C2B2
It was short, and thus conceived:--
0xF1A0FF30

0xDB06C2B2
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
0xD04A0F8B
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
0x57D5B49B
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
0xBF712058
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
0xF5BCA7A9
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
0x6EA6758E
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
0xE98D2627

0xDB06C2B2
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
0xF5334ED4

0xDB06C2B2
It was dated three years back.
0xF5BBE6A8

0xDB06C2B2
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
0x4312A245

0xDB06C2B2
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
0xC4D00969
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
0x961F0A35
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
0xF3331197
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
0xA9AAC460
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
0x4F696BB6
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
0x4A048737
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
0x6FE6616C
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
0xEF8103E2
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
0xB6F49822
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
0xCFDAFE8A

0xDB06C2B2
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
0x72FC58DE
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
0xAC183EA8
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
0x088FB059
passed since that day."
0xE3105B54

0xDB06C2B2
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
0xAD238E20
drawn breath, she went on thus--
0x8394F20F

0xDB06C2B2
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
0x070FBC19
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
0x0FAA4125
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
0xA607E0E1
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
0x3AE31E54
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose
0x27D6C066
my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
0x70D1ECD9
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
0x5A37F30D
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."
0x3DCE7525

0xDB06C2B2
"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
0x5AE4C9B9
regard me with kindness and forgiveness"
0xABAA35D4

0xDB06C2B2
"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel
0xFD1EF20D
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
0x5A918A06
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
0xB4EC1B02
violence, I can never comprehend."
0x9A239132

0xDB06C2B2
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
0x9B699967
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
0xC137ECFD
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
0xCDA4CAB9
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
0x16066C3D

0xDB06C2B2
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
0xE90BD3A5
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
0x2473B11B
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
0x40EC9846
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
0x9BDB60F2
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
0x1DAE337A

0xDB06C2B2
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
0xB971E2C9
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
0xFDFA0DE0

0xDB06C2B2
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
0x9CE8B3F6
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
0xD3EF9BF6
she must hate me still.
0xE145C804

0xDB06C2B2
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
0xACA4435A
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
0xF9010B10
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
0x90DB8007
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
0x0444B961
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
0x46ED5271
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
0xFC2B4733
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
0xDEAC7129
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
0xD07E480C
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
0xBCE8798D
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
0x637D10A2
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
0x67CE360F
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
0x8514EDA0
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
0x93AE0968
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
0x35EC2E75
form.
0x78BFC47F

0xDB06C2B2
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
0x494044F9
observed--
0x0DB0A5A5

0xDB06C2B2
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
0x49518B3F
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
0x30DD662C
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
0x01D25332
Neither of us had dropt a tear.

CHAPTER XXII
0xD2219BC7

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
0x499173EE
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
0x566B4AA6
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
0x53F8C15A
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
0x2D9BB80A
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
0x95AC7EA8
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
0x9DE1B990
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
0xF1AC0ED3
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
0xCAA372F1
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
0x8F4D9240
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
0xEEAD994D
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
0x1977A43E
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
0x629B449A
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
0x57DEF8F0
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
0xEE321CF8
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
0xC32A53A6
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
0x24C5DEDE
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
0x118068EA
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
0x402468C6
patient and compliant on my part."
0xAC07AFCE

0xDB06C2B2
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
0x0D56E2B8
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
0x455412E0
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
0x17DCAB5C
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
0x79C2FEC6
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
0x52E17749
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
0xCC9E97E0
notes of condolence.
0xB00D5F8A

0xDB06C2B2
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
0xBEB19D9D
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
0x340EAC8D
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
0xA3711CF1
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
0xA7116FFA
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
0xE64F05BE
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
0xEF5BD3D1
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
0x7465BE1F
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
0x60B047C8
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
0x40B2AD7A
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
0xF556C24B
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
0xAD26D003
veil."
0xF3BD28A6

0xDB06C2B2
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
0x878368B5
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
0x002654C4
good may it do you!"
0x95CBCF79

0xDB06C2B2
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
0x8733F093
you have some sense."
0x7ABD32D1

0xDB06C2B2
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
0x6BD249D9
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
0xAD9B76C1
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
0x808BCE92
much care."
0xD8EA0704

0xDB06C2B2
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
0x7906DF73
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
0xFB4DBA31
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
0x6E1AD62B
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
0x658C6E6B
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
0x113F8DCB
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
0xA4343C7F
fortune.
0x2D443C66

0xDB06C2B2
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
0xEE4F60F6
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
0x49490C69
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
0x59C74927
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
0xE1A050E7
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
0x3EA4FAC2
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
0x638BB94A
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
0x0F5C8C29
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
0x4F9E1189
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
0x96EA1D01

0xDB06C2B2
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
0xA187C76B
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
0xA3DAD029
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
0x73236D09
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
0x24C72A43
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
0xF3E46002
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
0x0399A8BA
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
0x2394E5C2
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
0xBFFA5EB7
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
0x5833F8D2
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
0x52697339
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
0xD6B92571
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
0x342A4951

0xDB06C2B2
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
0xCB3C5E8D
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
0xB3C40440
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
0x4D55396D
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
0x9FC59A27
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
0xBCDBE822
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
0xE9C17EFB
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
0xE80720E0
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
0x7BC594F5
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
0x0ADFF42A
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
0xDF74CD1C
don't doubt it."
0xC9632DAA

0xDB06C2B2
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
0xE2230FF0
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
0x9DE95CB8
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
0xD983E663
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
0xE08976A2
both her and me.
0x373F388B

0xDB06C2B2
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
0xAA350254
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
0x73005F25
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
0x9FFD96C3
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
0xD0305640
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
0x56075A9E
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
0xD6062E4A

0xDB06C2B2
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
0xB5245BEE
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
0xC2A86404
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
0xEAE0A661
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
0xC5235AFA
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
0x2B2B06A4
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
0x8E873CAB
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
0xFD4711F9

0xDB06C2B2
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
0x2F84F67C
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
0x05434132
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
0xCA90D71E
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
0x9B39FD06
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
0xC337CBAB
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
0xC14E0F3A
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
0x656BBEE7

0xDB06C2B2
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
0xB0F14F2F
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
0x2B35ADB9
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
0x09029245
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
0x6235D402
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
0x0F4148F0
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
0xDE095DB8
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
0xC8CEDE30

0xDB06C2B2
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
0xC2BAE036
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
0xD391E49F
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
0xD4E9E6D5
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
0x80DC9E44
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
0x9FF2ED1C
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
0xFB95FCE9
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
0x81964B2B
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
0x67283DB5

0xDB06C2B2
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
0x7964E135
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
0xE8CC9458
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
0xF9BED91A
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
0xD2F0C9A2
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
0xE84B4A9E
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
0x82FC7863

0xDB06C2B2
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
0x7AB00671
are!  Come on, if you please."
0x6B7C6571

0xDB06C2B2
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
0xDA6B865E
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
0xFAAE4516
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
0xF0DCD605
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
0xD2670EF7
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
0x6E5EB124
behave with decent composure.
0x697FA201

0xDB06C2B2
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
0x507E10C1
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
0x7268FA8F
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
0x45B32844
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
0x92897222
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
0x3D15ECDB
month?"
0x928F296F

0xDB06C2B2
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
0xCD569B01

0xDB06C2B2
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
0x23ECD486
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
0x13488661
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
0x808DE68E
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
0xD323CB90
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
0xDE149B42
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
0x33CB48E7
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
0x46833A87

0xDB06C2B2
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
0xD23B2730
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
0xCF90467B
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
0x0553DA7F
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
0xF6DE607A
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
0xD82DF2BF
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
0x3BCD3D37
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
0xFD037542
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
0x0BB659C3
that it were my home!
0x632C3515

0xDB06C2B2
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
0x3A336830
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
0xAEBE8499

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
0x1FD92268

0xDB06C2B2
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
0x92980730

0xDB06C2B2
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
0xA4DB9A5E

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
0xC3B4F8FB

0xDB06C2B2
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
0xDD5362CA
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
0xEBB7008C
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
0x43E8606C
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
0x3791BE90
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
0xCCE065DF
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
0xD3B6D6CC

0xDB06C2B2
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
0xDA7A5180
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
0x083FD1B7
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
0xB523D366

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
0x0A706A0F
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
0xA9FFDA5B
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
0x68A6FDEF
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
0xA1437852
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
0xDFED8729
shed it over me now.
0x808C2E65

0xDB06C2B2
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
0xA760BC0A
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
0xED0AD368

0xDB06C2B2
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
0xF882384F
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
0x2EB04EC4
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
0xFBAB5403
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
0x71568AEC

0xDB06C2B2
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
0xB73FD2BA
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
0x34E0B9CF

0xDB06C2B2
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
0xAC3C095F
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
0x61711DA5
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
0x48FFE812
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
0x04275082
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
0xD2380541
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
0x0E976657

0xDB06C2B2
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
0x0EC65465
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
0xF3C280C2
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
0x464B2ACF
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
0x0E232E09
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
0x5E166E43
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
0xBD26CC52
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
0x04BD1A64
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
0x3111115F
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
0x4CB41B8E
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
0x04C6A250
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
0x702F3A0D
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
0x56EF3F67
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
0x2D084887
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
0x761CF7B3

0xDB06C2B2
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
0x3620219B
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
0xEE4258F1
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
0xC00AC54C
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
0xC30017C0
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
0x3DAB6DB3
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
0xC0025A2F
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
0xF4CE936B

0xDB06C2B2
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
0x2EB453CC
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
0x73E07129
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
0x37EDF162
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
0x258C95DF
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
0xF897CE53
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
0x2BE6A631
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
0xB3730252
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
0x9357D9CD
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
0xEC14DF7C
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
0xF883FE64
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
0x3A6ABE94
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
0x35B24A7E
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.

CHAPTER XXIII
0x54216A71

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
0x38DBDE69
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
0x7F1DB035
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
0x264AE5D0
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
0x26972D4D
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
0x0EE2D9C5
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
0x50313788
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
0x211124D3
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
0x41352440

0xDB06C2B2
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
0xAD408FDF
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
0xA28A312E
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
0xF320F3A3

0xDB06C2B2
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
0x3BA09F53
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
0xEECDEB38
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
0x351B4E9F
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
0x2FD17D14
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
0xC3B68925
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
0x7CBB5F7D
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
0xC955F8AD
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
0xE78A6E7C

0xDB06C2B2
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
0xA6B2F78E
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
0x06B5AA2F
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
0x62182231
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
0x576C7603
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
0xA305F597
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
0x14709EF9
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
0x51C63813
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
0x69B9CA3B
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
0x85EF902B
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
0x0B54F51A
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
0xC9652116
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
0x77DD2B2B
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
0xF4CFC54F
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
0x7838CE51
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
0xED9F57C3

0xDB06C2B2
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
0xBE5BEFA7
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
0x3AB60107
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
0xA92D4833
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
0x152A16C7
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
0x20F19DA3
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
0x147C2930
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
0xC18F3C55
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
0xC3FF1CC9
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
0x2A66677F

0xDB06C2B2
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
0x7C3242E6
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
0x6C97B095
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
0xD18B94C6
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
0xF8EF6476
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
0xDA67115E
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
0x4BFD400F
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
0xA8C6E36E

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
0x71897C10
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
0xAECB7541

0xDB06C2B2
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
0xCC6F7D25
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
0xEEF81C15
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
0xF15A918A
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
0xED492059
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
0xA59E6E8F
turning--
0xA2270FA9

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
0xC8D37B39

0xDB06C2B2
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
0x8803B14B
started at first, and then I approached him.
0xE3DF226C

0xDB06C2B2
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
0x772863AB
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
0xE5E43A90
there! he is flown."
0x1D8AAAA6

0xDB06C2B2
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
0xCC741E93
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
0xEDFCCD3A

0xDB06C2B2
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
0xF4A914EF
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
0x0D527DE4
moonrise."
0xD4321D85

0xDB06C2B2
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
0x9411008D
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
0x363A6C9A
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
0x62E44929
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
0x8F2F3E3A
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
0xCCFE9A8D
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
0x710A606F
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
0x738D7CB9
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
0x22AF3E81
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
0x56965D7B
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
0xF5D6AF32
mind was unconscious and quiet.
0x8DA96F91

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
0xE9A6066F
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
0x08C8DEBD
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
0x129811EE

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
0xAA44D640
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
0xA48AB08A
Adhesiveness?"
0x8B9B8AFB

0xDB06C2B2
"I am attached to it, indeed."
0xDCD08F13

0xDB06C2B2
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a
0x171B45E2
degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for
0x9946C2C2
simple dame Fairfax?"
0x67A80DBB

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."
0x76BDDA35

0xDB06C2B2
"And would be sorry to part with them?"
0x0EBA392F

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
0x77B5B39D
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
0x381E5E4F
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
0x0BBEAA96
on, for the hour of repose is expired."
0x22B4DABA

0xDB06C2B2
"Must I move on, sir?" I asked.  "Must I leave Thornfield?"
0xA906D928

0xDB06C2B2
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
0x82F8F92E
must."
0xFFDBCF0D

0xDB06C2B2
This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.
0x64863A34

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes."
0xBF151523

0xDB06C2B2
"It is come now--I must give it to-night."
0x99F88EDA

0xDB06C2B2
"Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?"
0xB9E77B5F

0xDB06C2B2
"Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail
0xD555D338
straight on the head."
0x4B5D9AD5

0xDB06C2B2
"Soon, sir?"
0xAC104653

0xDB06C2B2
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
0xF53D9E01
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
0xC1C73199
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
0x0CA9985B
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
0x54664F8A
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
0x5D57DC4F
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
0x453C1677
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
0x6E85C725
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
0x1B551DC8
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
0x73808A82
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
0x0DC1CBD6
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
0xB80165B8
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
0x2EF17BC1
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
0x255F4037
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
0x3C94D821
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
0xBC991FB6
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
0x60FE4130
Eyre, must get a new situation."
0x5B27C06E

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
0xECB02849
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
0xD90B4875
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
0x76483B97
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
0x43E7C5AD

0xDB06C2B2
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
0x3E21EAF3
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum
0x89A3A788
for you."
0xF93A131A

0xDB06C2B2
"Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--"
0xADCADC99

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her
0xE1C956ED
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
0x549E6849
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
0x4B0388D4
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
0xF64C0BDB
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
0x3896D96B
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll
0x983CB3A1
like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."
0x425F563E

0xDB06C2B2
"It is a long way off, sir."
0x5F4566E6

0xDB06C2B2
"No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the
0x3443EE96
distance."
0x216EE58E

0xDB06C2B2
"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--"
0xB45E14CD

0xDB06C2B2
"From what, Jane?"
0x316045DD

0xDB06C2B2
"From England and from Thornfield: and--"
0xE0B2CD7C

0xDB06C2B2
"Well?"
0xB08D08AE

0xDB06C2B2
"From _you_, sir."
0x52E1EF4B

0xDB06C2B2
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
0x56148F35
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
0xF6597C22
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
0xD925F115
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
0xAC98FC46
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
0xC3B91D09
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
0xC40FAB1C
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
0xAC2F87EE
loved.
0xD3921373

0xDB06C2B2
"It is a long way," I again said.
0x06EF453D

0xDB06C2B2
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
0xC4FB9660
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
0x564D6376
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
0x7EA01AFB
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
0xDD3BE930

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
0xE4C75E1D
little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
0x7DF5C121
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
0xC01A0EC2
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
0xAF1C99CD
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
0x529342BE
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
0xF6F1F8CB
there together."  He seated me and himself.
0x1F5330B8

0xDB06C2B2
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
0x39A6A472
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
0x02FA57B0
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
0x3B8A55BA

0xDB06C2B2
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
0x5DD2947A

0xDB06C2B2
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
0x4E81AA98
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
0x09A06612
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
0x600D8D59
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
0x9BDEEF99
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
0x28A25A04
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
0x01F9AAD8
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
0xD8E62780
As for you,--you'd forget me."
0xE52084A1

0xDB06C2B2
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
0x35B07CE2

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
0x4B75B459

0xDB06C2B2
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
0x8ADD6073
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
0x67B70A26
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
0x7DF02023
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
0xEE51DB4E

0xDB06C2B2
"Because you are sorry to leave it?"
0x8B423A12

0xDB06C2B2
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
0xC767C92B
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
0x477997DD
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
0x39B20EDD
speak.
0x3CAEEF38

0xDB06C2B2
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
0x399E8B85
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
0x62750B8B
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
0x56255EE0
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
0x35E734A6
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
0x8893B06B
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
0x8C3C53B6
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
0x4CB71C10
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
0x92D23F78
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
0x57D40272
on the necessity of death."
0x3FCD2548

0xDB06C2B2
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
0x6B96EB95

0xDB06C2B2
"Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me."
0x4CCAA282

0xDB06C2B2
"In what shape?"
0x26415066

0xDB06C2B2
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
0x65411809

0xDB06C2B2
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"
0xC4BD9B0D

0xDB06C2B2
"But you will have."
0x61A479FA

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.
0x4AD9805F

0xDB06C2B2
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
0xFF8BDF02

0xDB06C2B2
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
0xB5743B14

0xDB06C2B2
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
0x7E138662
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
0x710CB4C9
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
0xB2E4AC9C
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
0x8E8C5E36
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
0xF10C166D
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
0x00239B42
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
0x360A6A99
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
0x35934330
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
0x14B4439C
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
0xB13AFBCD
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
0x03D69973
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
0x52CFF49A

0xDB06C2B2
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
0x5B591AE4
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
0x5918F19A
Jane!"
0x88AA1886

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
0x6748FB06
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
0xC1675191
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
0xF50BBA95
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
0xAA218215
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
0xFAA5280D

0xDB06C2B2
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
0x1D3F11D1

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
0x0E506DC1

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
0xEFD5852D
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
0x31A96FF9

0xDB06C2B2
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
0x8695EA41
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
0xECB8B363

0xDB06C2B2
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
0x41B51DD3

0xDB06C2B2
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
0x6F1E7CF1
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
0xA1B30D18

0xDB06C2B2
"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."
0x1729812B

0xDB06C2B2
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
0xE41814BC
best earthly companion."
0x6EA2E0B2

0xDB06C2B2
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
0x8A710562

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
0xC6F8FDCB
too."
0x0CA80BBA

0xDB06C2B2
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
0x4973075F
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
0x734FAA62
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
0x9A9877F0
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
0x9679A464
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
0x7A2BF92E
said--
0xF0D0D532

0xDB06C2B2
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
0x42796068

0xDB06C2B2
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
0x0CCF2316
return."
0xFA9309ED

0xDB06C2B2
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
0x1E9C5DAD

0xDB06C2B2
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
0xCEFBCB8B

0xDB06C2B2
"Come, Jane--come hither."
0x44C12A05

0xDB06C2B2
"Your bride stands between us."
0x2A8410D4

0xDB06C2B2
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
0x26BFE25E

0xDB06C2B2
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
0xA6CB9C13
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0xBA6267D0

0xDB06C2B2
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
0x6C3BE639
was still incredulous.
0xFC0BE152

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
0xE05FD9CB

0xDB06C2B2
"Entirely."
0xE7E7F84B

0xDB06C2B2
"You have no faith in me?"
0xCD1C1629

0xDB06C2B2
"Not a whit."
0xC09B5E4E

0xDB06C2B2
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
0xB4F84AA1
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
0xE492D0D5
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
0x4AC38DEF
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
0xFAD5D73A
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
0x30578AEC
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
0x382D09AC
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
0xDBD22A1F
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
0xE800890B
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
0x755E4B5F

0xDB06C2B2
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
0xEEEA983B
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
0xCCDF924E
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
0xDEA0C582
given me?"
0x413B7C92

0xDB06C2B2
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
0x8F036E8B
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
0xF364568B

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
0x1268264B

0xDB06C2B2
"Why?"
0x899CA234

0xDB06C2B2
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
0x59205D48

0xDB06C2B2
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
0xA78BF6CE
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
0x9F7069AE

0xDB06C2B2
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
0xB60EA158
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
0xBF27AF63

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
0x794E7C9C
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
0xD4E8DF87

0xDB06C2B2
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
0x7C292EB0
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
0x39375398

0xDB06C2B2
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
0xD650C01B
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
0x4733025A

0xDB06C2B2
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
0x7FA2D343
be your wife?"
0x40BE4B42

0xDB06C2B2
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
0x20D44AE5

0xDB06C2B2
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
0xC8266401

0xDB06C2B2
"Edward--my little wife!"
0xE0030ED7

0xDB06C2B2
"Dear Edward!"
0xE52A844C

0xDB06C2B2
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
0x6E648B4A
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
0x159739C0
happiness--I will make yours."
0xCFC6C67D

0xDB06C2B2
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
0xDE9F325D
have her, and will hold her."
0x5758E631

0xDB06C2B2
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
0x2F951805

0xDB06C2B2
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
0x651BF0FF
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
0x246F1E29
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
0x6A686E76
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
0x86586D35
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
0x75843880
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
0x1B691564
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
0xBA1C69E9
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
0x6129B83A
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
0x5CB15A23
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
0x7F7C2F25
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
0xB15D6A78

0xDB06C2B2
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
0x576216B2
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
0x89D0EFDC
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
0x6A542A46
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
0x6F62035B

0xDB06C2B2
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
0x07863E56
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
0x8D6F8B3A

0xDB06C2B2
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
0xAA8F3B80
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
0x05D19347
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
0xBFB30B31
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
0x0AC07C7A

0xDB06C2B2
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
0x9D819026
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
0x6E92205F
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
0xF16CFBCE
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
0x3CE990B2
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
0xC725818B
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
0xC30B2284

0xDB06C2B2
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
0x68C56F6F
night--good-night, my darling!"
0x426F098B

0xDB06C2B2
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
0x8803AA3F
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
0xB1C90C9B
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
0x02943840
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
0x455A17E8
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
0xCEE215FA
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
0x2FD5BDD4
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
0xE6C2299A
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
0xA71A88FD
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
0x9DF62332
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
0x732A9207
strength for anything.
0x57232278

0xDB06C2B2
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
0xCD2A51D2
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
0x489D6DA5
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.
0xEA1E428D

0xDB06C2B2
CHAPTER XXIV
0x20CA5134

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
0xF54779D4
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
0xD34DB8E7
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
0xF1755D16

0xDB06C2B2
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
0x184EBF3E
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
0x04ACA014
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
0x0C19B8DB
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
0x52004F8D
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
0x4861A178
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
0xA2AE759D
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
0x512CDDE5
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
0xDE4A055B
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
0x06AF8A12

0xDB06C2B2
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
0x85154E2E
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
0x0AF30596
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
0x04EC21EB
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
0x90C7D66E
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
0xE8AD277F
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
0x469B8DE8
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
0xC42B3C9F
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
0xF0AB5412
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
0x74BEDD58

0xDB06C2B2
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
0x1F839A3A
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
0x3AE884FF
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
0xCCDFFEC0
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
0xD227A1F4
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
0x8EE6FAC6
schoolroom.
0xD266C133

0xDB06C2B2
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
0xC4AC565F

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
0xBA9269DA

0xDB06C2B2
"Where is he?"
0xF49DDE82

0xDB06C2B2
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
0x75263B09
there he stood.
0xCADF6D7F

0xDB06C2B2
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
0xD3B197BA
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
0xE11DD7A0
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
0xE91C15C4
well loved, so caressed by him.
0xD42E001F

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
0x5BE0E901
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
0x692DC692
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
0xD1EFC6F0
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
0xBE97AC5B
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
0x3F24915F
new-dyed, I suppose.)
0xF7DE626E

0xDB06C2B2
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
0x6781817B

0xDB06C2B2
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
0xB342DE5A
more.  Do you hear that?"
0xED06E142

0xDB06C2B2
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
0x81CD4952
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
0x8BE7EB82
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
0xFE602CC2
think almost fear.
0x9C1778AB

0xDB06C2B2
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
0xD41590C0

0xDB06C2B2
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
0x31FDD4D1
strange."
0x46F5A4A6

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax
0x1108DA29
Rochester's girl-bride."
0xC9FD4750

0xDB06C2B2
"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
0xC76756A0
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
0x3FE0F49F
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
0x055A4968
a fairy tale--a day-dream."
0xA90DAABB

0xDB06C2B2
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
0x80A7BCC6
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
0xE0649E38
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
0xFDA5E757
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
0x165A7AE8
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
0x45581DB6

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
0x4D40204A
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
0xCA40DDEE
have them."
0x74222441

0xDB06C2B2
"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
0xD26EFCDC
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
0x436F1B5E
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
0x5E545310
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."
0x1981D6A1

0xDB06C2B2
"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
0xDEF6B8A7
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
0xD8F8070C
Quakerish governess."
0x40D478A8

0xDB06C2B2
"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
0x50232684
heart,--delicate and aerial."
0x79C82BF8

0xDB06C2B2
"Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are
0x81BE5E7F
sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"
0xF4A7B401

0xDB06C2B2
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
0xC62F0FCD
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
0x6DA5EAE2
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
0xF1502A22
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
0x5EB48C94
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
0xC2928DFC

0xDB06C2B2
"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
0x217FC35C
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
0x465FA23C
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
0x1FE81C67
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
0xBD24C977
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
0x6188FCD4
flatter me."
0xB0937F13

0xDB06C2B2
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
0x4C2CDBC1
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
0x637AE6B8
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
0x11763FF8
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
0x0838D904
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
0x2C979129
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
0xF9505BBE
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
0xC324AD32
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
0x64C9FED9
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
0x7E8EE0CB

0xDB06C2B2
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"
0x1D4DB91B

0xDB06C2B2
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
0xC5986E4C
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
0x48C93A9E
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
0x87437C50
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
0xF67F672E
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
0x2A4EEB63
as my comforter."
0x4919C2C7

0xDB06C2B2
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
0x7B65DFFE
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
0xBBF3E774
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
0x4D9BC0A0
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
0x6EEF5912
anticipate."
0x396CD498

0xDB06C2B2
"What do you anticipate of me?"
0x73CEC032

0xDB06C2B2
"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
0x86A24D0C
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
0x1800F21D
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
0x42059AFA
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
0xB98B5AD6
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
0x5EFD37E1
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
0x1D2E4C3E
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
0xF8BAF2CE
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my
0x018C0D1C
dear master."
0x9FB9EA54

0xDB06C2B2
"Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and
0x9034A398
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
0x69DA2692
you--with truth, fervour, constancy."
0x18AFDAC0

0xDB06C2B2
"Yet are you not capricious, sir?"
0xD961B40C

0xDB06C2B2
"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
0x66587E6A
find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a
0x05EC3993
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
0x10FBFE53
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul
0x33D1024B
made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once
0x3A072489
supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."
0x8F984FCF

0xDB06C2B2
"Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love
0x78891E88
such an one?"
0x775E547E

0xDB06C2B2
"I love it now."
0xBDACB0D6

0xDB06C2B2
"But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
0x5004F0C0
standard?"
0x265EDC2A

0xDB06C2B2
"I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you
0xFDFFC6C4
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
0x709E4BC7
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
0x6B3E43B9
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
0x0FAB1A3A
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
0x1B269A36
beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that
0x1ACD57E5
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"
0x4B3D70C9

0xDB06C2B2
"I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
0x54DFC3B7
was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--"
0x98D0EE09

0xDB06C2B2
"You were, you little elfish--"
0xE34735F7

0xDB06C2B2
"Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those
0x40FC2496
gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would
0xE543D9AD
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as
0xC62BCF49
suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year
0x7F2008F4
hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
0xD698A648
pleasure to grant."
0x94E7E730

0xDB06C2B2
"Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--"
0x4C865A38

0xDB06C2B2
"Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."
0xAB4F2EAB

0xDB06C2B2
"Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
0xC99FD871
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."
0x95417C72

0xDB06C2B2
"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
0x2E81820B
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
0x88360D66
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
0x90225A95

0xDB06C2B2
"I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted
0xEB2A7CE4
then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.
0xDE73292B
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be
0x7408B1AA
withdrawn: try again."
0x82CD07AB

0xDB06C2B2
"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much
0x9BB8EC1D
piqued on one point."
0x3DFE74F0

0xDB06C2B2
He looked disturbed.  "What? what?" he said hastily.  "Curiosity is a
0x6C66C3FB
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
0x70D0D28F
request--"
0x8261CC71

0xDB06C2B2
"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
0xADAA8B7F

0xDB06C2B2
"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps,
0xC69D1033
a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
0x2A3561C9

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you
0xEEBE34AA
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much
0x3485CF8B
rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your
0x30B89432
confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
0x8F60F3E5

0xDB06C2B2
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for
0xD4C2B397
God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't
0x00BF780E
turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
0xB3981864

0xDB06C2B2
"Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
0x074AE932
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
0xBB524B90
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
0x7C769FB6
entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
0xCC5411DB
of my power?"
0x0EF849B3

0xDB06C2B2
"I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is
0x7ACB905E
up."
0x154ED822

0xDB06C2B2
"Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows
0xEDDE1A4D
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
0x7B04C0F8
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
0xA41EA0FA
thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
0x76D39256

0xDB06C2B2
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
0x89D5DA04
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
0x7D7B44C4
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
0x6E3B3A52

0xDB06C2B2
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
0xD678C05E
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
0x7BB7B475
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
0xC7AEE57C
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
0x4EFA1D3A

0xDB06C2B2
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
0xD11EE206
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
0x1F4803F6
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
0x827E4BFE
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
0x4E57AB76
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
0xB9BCAE79
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
0xD92AFF5D
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
0x987C359D
made me the offer."
0x9ADD1186

0xDB06C2B2
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
0x3D9020A0

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
0x4673BFD1
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
0xD3A9399C
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
0xFFC1F271

0xDB06C2B2
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
0x48382E76
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
0xA7B6E42D
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
0xA6440DD8

0xDB06C2B2
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
0xC602DC50
Were you jealous, Jane?"
0x08FCE670

0xDB06C2B2
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
0x9B7A9314
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
0xC1892E20
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
0x017BBDF9
deserted?"
0x38114D97

0xDB06C2B2
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
0xDA85217B
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
0x4377EB00
moment."
0x1A10D616

0xDB06C2B2
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
0x06505F4C
principles on some points are eccentric."
0x010E5B3F

0xDB06C2B2
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
0x3D6AC365
awry for want of attention."
0xD27498C3

0xDB06C2B2
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
0x6542BE12
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
0x0B4545DB
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
0xCFBC80A7

0xDB06C2B2
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
0x049821FD
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
0xA45098C1
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
0xB289AB1E

0xDB06C2B2
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
0xD18A56BB
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
0x61C13654
express.
0x5FC1980F

0xDB06C2B2
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
0xA11509FF
entreated, and to yield."
0xEBACDF02

0xDB06C2B2
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
0xE5908269
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
0xE9C191A5
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
0x0E761449
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
0xAEC8810F

0xDB06C2B2
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
0xB40F4660
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
0xABD998A9
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
0x8C21704B
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
0x9A26DFFB

0xDB06C2B2
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
0x7E443898

0xDB06C2B2
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
0x668EA0A4
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
0xBE97329C

0xDB06C2B2
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
0xB0887996
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
0x57E7F71B
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
0x83F956A4
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
0x94FB63CA
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
0x591E6E3F
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
0xCEF1F74E
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
0x4A7B789B
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
0x16B22BAF
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
0x762160E8
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
0x83CFCA16

0xDB06C2B2
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
0xF03B5168
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
0xE980166B
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
0xD62B7F17
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
0x4CCB37CC
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
0x8A244A2F
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
0x86C6B2D7
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
0xDB89A162
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
0x54D04029
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
0xCA817E9C
you would be his wife."
0x6CECB322

0xDB06C2B2
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
0xA0F27024

0xDB06C2B2
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
0x52A3F4DE

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
0xC978537D
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
0x5937F138
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
0xE9826021

0xDB06C2B2
"He tells me so."
0xB9B4871B

0xDB06C2B2
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
0xEB06C7C0
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
0x41151CEC

0xDB06C2B2
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
0x27A781E8
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
0xBC4DE9D7
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
0x09E609EF
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
0x93B4E2EA
father."
0xE2B97C0F

0xDB06C2B2
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
0x2EC3A454
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
0x17481EF2
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
0x905ED39F
twenty."
0xDEF58657

0xDB06C2B2
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
0x333C7815

0xDB06C2B2
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
0x42BFD055
eyes.
0x4666599C

0xDB06C2B2
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
0x34C0E340
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
0xF16AD291
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
0xA458DD37
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
0xEEEE3B44
I expect."
0x26067D01

0xDB06C2B2
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
0x245DE96A
should have a sincere affection for me?"
0x335D8A02

0xDB06C2B2
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
0x514779D3
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
0x3CC26E33
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
0x825678AA
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
0x8FEB9D87
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
0x11B02239
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
0x2E8A21B9
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
0x7F92D212
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
0xAC95E252
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
0x30C54993
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
0x3A03B21E
him."
0x50126532

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
0x6528C826
that all was right."
0x0A37B466

0xDB06C2B2
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
0xFC341D26
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
0xE21FC253
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
0xE81D00EA
accustomed to marry their governesses."
0x573C953E

0xDB06C2B2
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
0x03387A00

0xDB06C2B2
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
0x473F305B
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
0xD17630AC
me go mademoiselle."
0x0A99D44E

0xDB06C2B2
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
0xDC42E258
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
0x1D8044AC
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
0x61AA03DD
backwards and forwards.
0x38AC9664

0xDB06C2B2
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
0x5DAFEF72

0xDB06C2B2
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."
0xA8107530

0xDB06C2B2
"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
0x283F951F

0xDB06C2B2
"Not it: she will be a restraint."
0x9D386FF8

0xDB06C2B2
He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
0x1329B06F
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
0xEEC421E8
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
0x6B46494B
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
0x2BC075D5
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
0x3B6240B1
my face.
0x9CAAD1D6

0xDB06C2B2
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
0x5796230D
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
0x7A8F567F

0xDB06C2B2
"I would far rather she went, sir."
0x4AF343DC

0xDB06C2B2
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
0xDCDDA996
to Adele.
0x8579B963

0xDB06C2B2
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
0x0175DCCB

0xDB06C2B2
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
0x34FC78A8
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
0x20ED2126
company--for life."
0x1F480B22

0xDB06C2B2
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
0xEE04054F
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
0x308490A0
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
0x8828FA96
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
0xE0A5D846
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
0x07010D2E

0xDB06C2B2
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
0xC0B4C9B6
there is plenty of room on this side."
0xD4471037

0xDB06C2B2
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
0x14B64690
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
0x8E919610

0xDB06C2B2
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
0x948A06D9
mademoiselle?"
0x8940B5E6

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
0x514924B2
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
0x5F4F6DDF
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
0x6A4BBB65
there, and only me."
0x95123684

0xDB06C2B2
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
0x90A9928D

0xDB06C2B2
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
0x1C92CCAB
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
0x75F6DC3D

0xDB06C2B2
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
0x8D5D224B

0xDB06C2B2
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
0x83C716A8
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
0xD619F791

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
0xF1CE7433
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
0xC7CEEB5C

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
0x6DB1F1F9
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
0x737D074D
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
0x77364C67
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
0x22BE98E8

0xDB06C2B2
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
0xBCA5C986
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
0x1436E116
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
0xA3772D6C

0xDB06C2B2
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
0xA461EAE6

0xDB06C2B2
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
0xAB783180
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
0x283549CB

0xDB06C2B2
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
0x88773137
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
0xF6D21C05
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
0x7105EEAA
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
0xE28CD7B0

0xDB06C2B2
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
0x3CDD9949
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
0x92937451
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
0x338CC12F
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
0x01DDD472
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
0xD75B3B72
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
0x15578FF8
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
0xDB1DEADF
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
0x75481419
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
0x17D88B0C
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
0xA7292E94
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
0x83DAA200
effect--
0x16B4714D

0xDB06C2B2
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
0xE4ECEFF1
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
0x9FF789E3
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
0x51EBB9B9
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
0x5871A590
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
0xE4BBE453
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
0xEE45E128

0xDB06C2B2
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
0xBCE80BED
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
0x771FFC6E
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
0x6EA9ED47
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
0x3FE349DF
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
0xBA6D9667
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
0xECD94DF3
again."
0xDB9B5DD0

0xDB06C2B2
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
0xA01B2607
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
0x0DE15FFF

0xDB06C2B2
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
0xB33E7001
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
0x09D9194F
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
0xB8E2028A
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
0x2775F327
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
0x52467675
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
0xF4370A71
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
0xCE43CF19

0xDB06C2B2
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
0x61F1CF3A
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
0xE68B8B56
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
0x6251BE7E
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
0x8C6FC240
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
0x87422F81
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
0x9773EF1E
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
0x9A9E61E9
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
0x1F6CD904
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
0xB406BE85
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
0x5F272784
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
0x042D0FD5
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
0x51C62A14
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
0x6F41EBBE
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
0xA0790E5F

0xDB06C2B2
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
0xE6E274E8
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
0x4C8E1D55
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
0x036E1022
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
0x45DA5B13
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
0xE8B3256E
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
0x57EE7662
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
0x429BA966
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
0x76201EE2
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
0x3289B18E
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
0x12CDD4B5
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
0xF640D6A3
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
0xA9AEBE47
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
0x68B107E8
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
0x040878B6
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
0x7DAA1683
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
0x248DC97B
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
0x4C4D3C46
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
0x14FF192F
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
0x287AF7AD
passionate pressure.
0x808EC574

0xDB06C2B2
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
0xDCAFE673
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
0x18AD641B
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
0x218D806D
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
0x4982DA4C
satin."
0x733EDA3A

0xDB06C2B2
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
0xA2C44459
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
0x8DA0D1FB
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
0x9717D944
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
0x33BFC8C5

0xDB06C2B2
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
0xB35D979C
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
0xBB5B8137
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
0xDA601501
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
0x2DF633BA
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
0x056E7B82
satisfactorily here."
0x2A720415

0xDB06C2B2
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
0xAB117061
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
0x542EB974

0xDB06C2B2
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to
0x0260D547
them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get
0x98D54E60
admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as
0x79F6312B
you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:
0x2B6ED03C
nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a
0x439E4508
charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."
0x5390EC43

0xDB06C2B2
"I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."
0x98FACC6B

0xDB06C2B2
"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an
0x40A39708
eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever
0x0A071DEE
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,
0x174997C9
would be to violate its conditions."
0x326A4FB8

0xDB06C2B2
"Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through
0x8913E832
a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You
0xF5B3C36C
will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?"
0x3EA1566F

0xDB06C2B2
"I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.  Do
0xB2FCBA18
you remember what you said of Celine Varens?--of the diamonds, the
0x1CB5616D
cashmeres you gave her?  I will not be your English Celine Varens.  I
0x338C2B7C
shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I shall earn my board
0x9BBB0111
and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.  I'll furnish my own
0xA364BA5B
wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but--"
0x3F2E9B69

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, but what?"
0x8660CB8E

0xDB06C2B2
"Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit."
0x94AC66FC

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your
0xF020EB96
equal," said he.  We were now approaching Thornfield.  "Will it please
0xB413D2C1
you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.
0x6D9EFCF1

0xDB06C2B2
"No, thank you, sir."
0x06BB5852

0xDB06C2B2
"And what for, 'no, thank you?' if one may inquire."
0xAFC47DFC

0xDB06C2B2
"I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now:
0xA54AFCED
till--"
0xEFA569B0

0xDB06C2B2
"Till what?  You delight in half-phrases."
0xDC013464

0xDB06C2B2
"Till I can't help it."
0x77410619

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the
0x607F5156
companion of my repast?"
0xF8333232

0xDB06C2B2
"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as
0x226B4CBF
usual for another month."
0xDBDC25F3

0xDB06C2B2
"You will give up your governessing slavery at once."
0x4CAC251C

0xDB06C2B2
"Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.  I shall just go on with
0xD4DE435F
it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
0x7A677B44
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
0xD4E7EB8D
disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
0x6A4A9BCE

0xDB06C2B2
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this,
0x4D54D195
'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I
0xE18ADF10
have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It
0x6D78E30C
is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when
0xC659CEBE
once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll
0x1DDC464D
just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this" (touching
0x1959BF2C
his watch-guard).  "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest
0x1C86B5C8
my jewel I should tyne."
0xE1CC8279

0xDB06C2B2
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
0x7C2132B8
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
0xE3E0F6B6
retreat upstairs.
0x7D991DD7

0xDB06C2B2
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
0xCFFBBA02
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
0xBF89E87A
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
0x4DFCA2A3
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
0xD027059E
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
0x018A2C14
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
0x94666435
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
0x0D870060
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
0xF949F303
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
0x5A1D35F6
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
0xEB48570F
the present.
0x4BEF98BE

0xDB06C2B2
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
0xA71DED49

0xDB06C2B2
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
0xD2B55B97
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
0x6E0564E3
stimulate it.
0x1ADA9D55

0xDB06C2B2
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
0xA0B16635

0xDB06C2B2
"Very well, sir, I will try."
0x71C43806

0xDB06C2B2
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
0x40682648
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
0x4A90C7F9
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
0xDBE26DA1
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
0xF1D95FC8
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
0x350EA079
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
0xC1CE4FB0
strain:--
0x16E28980

0xDB06C2B2
   "The truest love that ever heart
0xF39358D2
      Felt at its kindled core,
0x6481BE74
   Did through each vein, in quickened start,
0xE0AD9D86
      The tide of being pour.
0x517C951F

0xDB06C2B2
   Her coming was my hope each day,
0x3C66773E
      Her parting was my pain;
0xC5CA7B8C
   The chance that did her steps delay
0x00FB8A25
      Was ice in every vein.
0x1DDA74F4

0xDB06C2B2
   I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
0x44840D60
      As I loved, loved to be;
0xFF4EED22
   And to this object did I press
0x0E2D5B75
      As blind as eagerly.
0xCB83C2FD

0xDB06C2B2
   But wide as pathless was the space
0xE49B37A5
      That lay our lives between,
0xDE2A45D6
   And dangerous as the foamy race
0x4A196C7B
      Of ocean-surges green.
0x71C7208B

0xDB06C2B2
   And haunted as a robber-path
0xC194AEA2
      Through wilderness or wood;
0x09263BBA
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
0xD4F9731C
      Between our spirits stood.
0x013271D4

0xDB06C2B2
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
0x46C39821
      I omens did defy:
0xB5DAA6D1
   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
0x52D329D2
      I passed impetuous by.
0x744F76E4

0xDB06C2B2
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
0x4089F234
      I flew as in a dream;
0x6E9B628B
   For glorious rose upon my sight
0xF0663FED
      That child of Shower and Gleam.
0x9B6B8D04

0xDB06C2B2
   Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
0xCFB67B7D
      Shines that soft, solemn joy;
0x58941A07
   Nor care I now, how dense and grim
0x82503D63
      Disasters gather nigh.
0xCFB72F44

0xDB06C2B2
   I care not in this moment sweet,
0x2997E85E
      Though all I have rushed o'er
0x30B94C98
   Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
0xB59549CE
      Proclaiming vengeance sore:
0x378652DE

0xDB06C2B2
   Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
0xCC4F46A9
      Right, bar approach to me,
0x4538A08C
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,
0x300593DB
      Swear endless enmity.
0x64B47EAA

0xDB06C2B2
   My love has placed her little hand
0x8020B7DA
      With noble faith in mine,
0x07BED1CD
   And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
0x62C6ED3D
      Our nature shall entwine.
0x5E0EF56A

0xDB06C2B2
   My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
0x76F1D522
      With me to live--to die;
0x430C2CC5
   I have at last my nameless bliss.
0xC2603B80
      As I love--loved am I!"
0x12D73629

0xDB06C2B2
He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
0xBA8DE3AE
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
0x63305F62
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
0x2B2D95D8
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
0x751F6B1B
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
0x42106C51
"whom he was going to marry now?"
0xA4F9E56F

0xDB06C2B2
"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
0x605641CD

0xDB06C2B2
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
0x332EFA9A
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
0xFBE39178
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."
0xAE7946BD

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
0x3D59C047
Death was not for such as I."
0x55003F90

0xDB06C2B2
"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had:
0x800C8B18
but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
0x6936FBA3

0xDB06C2B2
"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
0x4FC823D9
reconciling kiss?"
0x8360AEF6

0xDB06C2B2
"No: I would rather be excused."
0x289B6A63

0xDB06C2B2
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
0x5C80E9FB
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
0x3BBC2001
stanzas crooned in her praise."
0x540ED4EE

0xDB06C2B2
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
0x788E3E9A
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
0x89537987
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
0xAFCFDBC0
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
0x07BF71C7
time to rescind it.
0x2C213C0D

0xDB06C2B2
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
0x0776A1DA

0xDB06C2B2
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
0x037E4C94
myself I was doing that now."
0x920C5E26

0xDB06C2B2
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
0x1D39DA92
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
0x96F71F09
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
0x92B25427
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
0xC7CD025E
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
0xE1083B4D
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
0x1450D54D
advantage."
0x8D4039D1

0xDB06C2B2
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
0x58698806
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
0x2FF66C2B
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
0xDDA001A5
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
0x77C4C39E

0xDB06C2B2
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
0xBDDA41A2
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
0xE20DCCE2
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
0xA156F98C
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
0x4C353F2F
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
0xAFD25852
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
0x2DF25574

0xDB06C2B2
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
0x6BEF67F9
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
0x5A72FE90
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
0x986A5977
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
0x86138FD8
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
0x311040DD
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
0x0CC46F90
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
0xA95D6766
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
0x24C2FF57
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
0x8A627D9E
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
0xE28DA30F
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
0x11FFFBAD
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
0xB945D079
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
0x50ECC03F
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
0x577DA50D
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
0x0E05EFE4
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
0x3D505A2A
virtue, another must be devised."
0xB6FDD97C

0xDB06C2B2
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
0x58966117
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
0x8068631D
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
0x19201B31
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
0x06AEE9B1
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
0x6E1BC064
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
0x18A6D4CB

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
0xA2D99167
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
0x81BF36F8
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
0xE1ABECCF
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
0x5D94F490
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
0x40F3F658
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
0xA46A6DCB
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
0x4FDCA26D
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
0x6EA98120
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
0x55898C0B
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
0x2FB1A590
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
0xC4A7724E
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
0xC426D9BE
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
0x71C82CCB
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
0x96ADFA74
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
0x68137C53
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
0xDC24BB5E
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
0x36B1327E
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
0x17F954DD
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
0xD4E338F6
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
0x54A4586F
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
0x7C4DF030
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
0x394FFA0D
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
0x59F59BB6

0xDB06C2B2
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
0xC1831E08
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
0x7F237EC5
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
0x700490CB
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
0x6EAE4BB2
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
0xA615FAD3
more than they.
0xEC20CBE2

0xDB06C2B2
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
0xA533F7F7
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
0xBF147DFA
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
0x883E82AA
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
0x8C2919BD
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
0xC8228960
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
0xBDE8506D
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
0x2C10EDED
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
0x7E0D9081
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
0xD2116EE8
to him, you shall share the confidence.
0xBD338F95

0xDB06C2B2
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
0x436E9734
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
0xEF082E0D
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
0x289E9854
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
0xD3985E65
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
0x034DE0F9
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
0xFA721F84
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
0x08DE6228
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
0x78CC0DA2

0xDB06C2B2
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
0x7DB08A55
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
0x9C136ED9
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
0xFF357F69
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
0xC9606868
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
0xCF096C67
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
0xB2605477
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
0x7762A1DD
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
0xCC2A28DF
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
0x6C75E646
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
0xB4C538C5

0xDB06C2B2
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
0xD11835C7
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
0x6DEBB8BB
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
0xB778C9D9
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
0x4705940A
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
0xB5279397
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
0x1278F891
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
0x53A0CDD6
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
0x0AB7FEDD
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
0xB831EE25
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
0xA81405C5
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
0x33EF44AB
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
0x8F72B4D2
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
0x0869260D
listen to, and I ran off again.
0x7C708AE1

0xDB06C2B2
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
0xF8F5CF47
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
0x735754DB
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
0x1118AB49
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
0xFF5B2DE9
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
0xACBE1FC1
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
0x013F7184
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
0x1D052B75
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
0xC871A307
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
0xF60FB821
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
0x36E4FE61
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
0xD2D7E510
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
0x6FDCC720
simultaneously struck ten.
0xB6AB64A9

0xDB06C2B2
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
0x7DE7F6C4
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
0xB8B708B6
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
0x40A5BDFA

0xDB06C2B2
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
0xE75AB580
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
0x3D80615E
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
0x9E750D82
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
0xE0D07735
by one moving speck.
0xC5C273EB

0xDB06C2B2
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
0x6D93563B
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
0x856F0EC5
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
0xCCAAA790
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
0xAA265D54

0xDB06C2B2
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
0xD355357F
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
0x5C2F505C
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
0xF96EB149
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
0x1BB21305
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
0xD2BDAB56
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
0x9A39D035
meridian, and must now decline.
0x47C1139D

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
0x47D769E4
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
0xDDC15F16
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
0xA55D8AFC

0xDB06C2B2
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
0xF41A4402
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
0xC110D332
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
0xE66AEEC1
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
0x5AA8D354
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
0xB45AE7D5
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
0x59C7D781

0xDB06C2B2
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
0xFFB1F75E
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
0x7DFFC495
give me both hands: mount!"
0xBBA16A8E

0xDB06C2B2
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
0x1B4718CB
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
0x646124D2
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
0xF6BDDB1C
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
0x21EDF1E8
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
0x770AE7A9

0xDB06C2B2
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
0xB8979CA6
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
0x809C906D

0xDB06C2B2
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
0x5E449CAC
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
0xD09EC6F5
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
0x2952B8B1

0xDB06C2B2
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
0x8E3C090A

0xDB06C2B2
"Then you have been both?"
0x928B8DD0

0xDB06C2B2
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
0x28A05A1B
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
0xC4A7419A

0xDB06C2B2
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
0xE392D1A0
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
0xE7452571
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
0x19118D1A
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
0x39C5C910
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
0xE943D4C3
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
0xF185C9DA

0xDB06C2B2
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
0xECF990EE
get down."
0xE88AEE53

0xDB06C2B2
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
0x4D9685A3
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
0x19101A78
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
0xEA67DAD9
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
0x5D3D6D7A
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
0x07F77910

0xDB06C2B2
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
0x1E8BA2C2
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
0x0C0858FD

0xDB06C2B2
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
0x09BA1285
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
0xED2539F5
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
0x1E664F0A

0xDB06C2B2
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
0xE3A6B8AB
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
0x7CAF969B

0xDB06C2B2
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
0x546066B3

0xDB06C2B2
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
0x5D7C5420

0xDB06C2B2
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
0xFD4C7B59
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
0xEF9895C0
as a long, strong arm.
0x3F028033

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
0x80942189
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
0xE0F8C962

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, Jane."
0x795A3172

0xDB06C2B2
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
0xDC23A96D
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
0x808502D9

0xDB06C2B2
"It is near midnight," I said.
0x81D600D4

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
0x856BF64B
my wedding."
0xCD7E33D8

0xDB06C2B2
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
0xE1D5EF6C
no wish to go to bed."
0x829C71E4

0xDB06C2B2
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
0x48558C70

0xDB06C2B2
"All, sir."
0xD0A97552

0xDB06C2B2
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
0x576788EC
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
0xF9D4AFED
from church."
0xDB71D8C3

0xDB06C2B2
"Very well, sir."
0x288311E4

0xDB06C2B2
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
0xDF7EB633
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
0xC72160DC
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
0xBD862F1B

0xDB06C2B2
"I believe I am."
0xDEB7E1D7

0xDB06C2B2
"Believe!  What is the matter?  Tell me what you feel."
0x0FB9007C

0xDB06C2B2
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
0xF38C3782
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
0x3E66040F
charged?"
0x29226640

0xDB06C2B2
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
0x6FDB82FC
over-fatigued."
0x1ED59F52

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
0xC7D356AF

0xDB06C2B2
"Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core."
0x04C374B6

0xDB06C2B2
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
0xDAF1AD19
and flushed.
0x76AF7560

0xDB06C2B2
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
0xBA5153E7
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
0x166F41B8
I shall not prove a good husband?"
0x9E95DFBC

0xDB06C2B2
"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."
0x8E018FEB

0xDB06C2B2
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
0xEE8E2EDD
new life into which you are passing?"
0x5F05C3C4

0xDB06C2B2
"No."
0xBB39FC9B

0xDB06C2B2
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
0x6CE60136
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
0x42C2F9A6

0xDB06C2B2
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
0x9988BE31

0xDB06C2B2
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
0x4D864A00
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
0xEB0C61A5
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
0xD7B901C2
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
0x02DF67A0
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
0x576EA748

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
0x80F528AC
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
0xB9D0583A
proceeded.
0xBA0D2BDF

0xDB06C2B2
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
0xF68CFFD7
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
0xB59A5B27
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
0x20B39506
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
0x8E85431D
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
0x4748944B
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
0x115D3787
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
0x4BEB0556
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
0xCE0C2074
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
0xD5FA4C17
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
0x96629400
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
0xA1735099
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
0x9500DA25
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
0x1563B1F2
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
0xB7CE84BD
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
0xDCE36ED2
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
0x2368EAD6
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
0xC2CC6A27
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
0x6DA6C153
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
0x758C4EE7
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
0x4D9A88F2
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
0x6491EE4D
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
0xE592EDE5
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
0xC14A9A88
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
0x271E10C4
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
0x11F41454
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
0xD6C4A897
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
0x6BF4C339
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
0xC798EBF8
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
0x9C877AC0
coronet."
0x4DE7A25E

0xDB06C2B2
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
0xF0DF431C
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
0x5D0BA352
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
0xCE24F419

0xDB06C2B2
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
0xFA2F5799
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
0x9DB37BC2
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
0x7FE49097
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
0x38A8AB38
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
0x5E0437ED
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
0xC3118A65
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
0x05134464
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
0xCAD00ED9
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
0xA1EED536
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
0xAE34EB31
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
0x07DA2A23
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
0xF6A7CD45
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
0x7AA8DC00
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
0xB26B01D0
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
0xD103365E
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
0xFA749BD8
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
0xDC8E071C
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
0xF51EF13F
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
0xE675F87F
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
0xD73D8827
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
0xDAFCAC50
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
0xD8D5628F
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
0x1BF25F26
moment."
0x1A10D616

0xDB06C2B2
"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
0x6DB9ECF1
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
0x133C5D04
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
0x1A4A9CC1
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
0xB704C805
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
0x8F05BBD1
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
0x995A5906
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,
0x86C5B6B2
Jane?--repeat it."
0xC786659F

0xDB06C2B2
"I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart."
0x355519DA

0xDB06C2B2
"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
0x55FD4377
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
0x83DA43C9
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
0xB7F6D782
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
0x9A5A438D
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
0xA6C2757E
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
0x0DA088AA
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
0x15FFF918
incensed than saddened."
0xC9AB3D09

0xDB06C2B2
"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have
0xAEC6A3F8
finished my tale: but hear me to the end."
0x89CFCD2E

0xDB06C2B2
"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source
0xEF686354
of your melancholy in a dream."
0xF071A687

0xDB06C2B2
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
0x50A15207
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."
0x98D3BEFE

0xDB06C2B2
The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
0x8B4552D6
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
0xB72048D2

0xDB06C2B2
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
0x7F2D8217
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
0x0B3DF380
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
0x637EC6F6
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
0x3592B417
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
0x844AD3A6
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
0x68455555
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
0x399D95A0
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
0x87B0CF3E
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
0x8CE8CB26
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
0x59B3B908
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
0x530BA169
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
0xE6187F8D
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
0x70459F2A
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
0x92686C2D
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
0x9E858DF3
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
0xF90F7A74
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
0x707A9AEF
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
0x659F5B03
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
0x6D0ADECE
woke."
0xAC1D47B8

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, Jane, that is all."
0x3E04EF29

0xDB06C2B2
"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
0xAD335060
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
0xA37DEEFE
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
0x94F35644
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
0x5E1280B2
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
0xECC40246
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
0x50329C60
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
0x5896C77E
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
0x8F6B514E
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
0xEFD674A4
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
0x15D53AA3
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
0x66B9FF5A
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
0x3098DE8A
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."
0x9607A347

0xDB06C2B2
"It must have been one of them," interrupted my master.
0xD4BAF859

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
0xB107D9A4
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
0x1EC60C2E
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
0x9F19873D

0xDB06C2B2
"Describe it, Jane."
0xB19C566A

0xDB06C2B2
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
0xA8A35996
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
0xF6D445C2
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."
0x35F3E72E

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you see her face?"
0x47420561

0xDB06C2B2
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
0x0EE91D18
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
0xB354CB0D
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
0x0BEB9081
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."
0x39DF2A52

0xDB06C2B2
"And how were they?"
0x1D024DF7

0xDB06C2B2
"Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was
0x6CC793FD
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
0xD1FFF8D3
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"
0x0A62BD08

0xDB06C2B2
"Ghosts are usually pale, Jane."
0x92517B7B

0xDB06C2B2
"This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow
0xE161090D
furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall
0x822D4AB0
I tell you of what it reminded me?"
0x5727BF74

0xDB06C2B2
"You may."
0x53416A97

0xDB06C2B2
"Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre."
0xB604C77E

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah!--what did it do?"
0x7B2444A4

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0xEC33B1DD
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them."
0xD58EA2B6

0xDB06C2B2
{It removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0x858ED441
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them: p272.jpg}
0x249C8D24

0xDB06C2B2
"Afterwards?"
0x8E486CD4

0xDB06C2B2
"It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn
0x5FC9BDF0
approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
0x3CF455D3
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
0x05FC664D
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
0x96035AFD
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for
0x9F04BE7F
the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible
0x90688E13
from terror."
0x87E9A1F1

0xDB06C2B2
"Who was with you when you revived?"
0xDFD7D20C

0xDB06C2B2
"No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in
0xF68AC9E0
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
0xC6B54C25
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,
0xC8271CFC
sir, tell me who and what that woman was?"
0xB91BFD75

0xDB06C2B2
"The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.  I must be
0xDF04A57F
careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough
0x467360AF
handling."
0x404C02E0

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the
0xF8098B03
transaction actually took place."
0xC5C38043

0xDB06C2B2
"And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a
0x528C2556
ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you
0x258CA728
without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?"
0x3360D7D8

0xDB06C2B2
"Not yet."
0x9E390AD7

0xDB06C2B2
"Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind
0xAB116D4F
us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
0xE3737B09
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
0xB0504561

0xDB06C2B2
"Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
0x90734E18
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
0xD05CA2C8
mystery of that awful visitant."
0x9F1536B6

0xDB06C2B2
"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
0xAC14CA71

0xDB06C2B2
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
0x9CA2EDF2
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
0x5765998F
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
0xE5C229F6
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
0xCD80EF3B
to bottom in two halves!"
0xA349F37D

0xDB06C2B2
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
0xF3DB0136
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
0xFC6C24CF
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
0xAD095941
might have happened!"
0xB52F8922

0xDB06C2B2
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
0xE3855CA5
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
0xB6EBE4DC

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
0xCA701705
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
0x085B44BA
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
0xDBDC48E2
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
0xD543954D
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
0x7C267011
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
0xE6D49E0C
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
0x7322AEB0
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
0xBBBCC946
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
0xD0212793
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
0x2FAD697C
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
0xA8893394
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
0x26477D7E
solution of the mystery?"
0x247DA45B

0xDB06C2B2
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
0xCE7CE258
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
0x27EDC0F7
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
0xD0E220AE
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
0xB89B1D5E

0xDB06C2B2
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
0xC2992A04
candle.
0x11CF5FFC

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
0xF32E3B7B
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
0x6F231B20
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
0x8BF6990E
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
0x121E9F47

0xDB06C2B2
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
0x42AAF07C

0xDB06C2B2
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
0x2580E48D
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
0xCE1C736E
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
0x366B4FF3
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
0xF5E4A6DD
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
0x3FF1BC5E
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
0x17D05EE3
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
0x966740A7

0xDB06C2B2
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
0x741A1FD1
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
0x8E8BA21F
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
0xC2AC8154

0xDB06C2B2
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
0xF532F202
Janet now?"
0x3E712F1D

0xDB06C2B2
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
0x94BFB4E4

0xDB06C2B2
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
0xB78D0B61
love and blissful union."
0xECA3992E

0xDB06C2B2
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
0x58013DDD
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
0xEA46B6B4
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
0x3FE907F3
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
0xE4B83CEA
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
0x47BD6DF1
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
0x205D5C42
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
0x95F96F87
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
0x76A21F5B
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
0xE1ABC6FB
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
0x4484E709
day.

CHAPTER XXVI
0xF4244BAC

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
0xDD1C2842
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
0x24250264
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
0x19CEA5DA
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
0xBEC13E15
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
0x12C75BC6

0xDB06C2B2
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
0x9C9894A3
not taken one peep."
0xD78885C7

0xDB06C2B2
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
0x81E0F5D5
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
0x5B83A74A
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
0xA4857762
by Mr. Rochester.
0x9567AA9F

0xDB06C2B2
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
0xC50A6180
so long!"
0xA5423E73

0xDB06C2B2
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
0x876AF7E0
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
0x1FEDC47A
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
0xA1866658
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
0x4B87F4D0
footman, answered it.
0x81993A16

0xDB06C2B2
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
0xB339BBE2

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"Is the luggage brought down?"
0xF2B94349

0xDB06C2B2
"They are bringing it down, sir."
0x84A4243F

0xDB06C2B2
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
0x31480DEE
there: return and tell me."
0x0F1827FC

0xDB06C2B2
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
0xD1E0AE12
footman soon returned.
0x78991764

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
0x692CDB23

0xDB06C2B2
"And the carriage?"
0xD670B91B

0xDB06C2B2
"The horses are harnessing."
0x73120858

0xDB06C2B2
"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we
0x2A9F4324
return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
0xFD8E6632
coachman in his seat."
0xEC0AD633

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, are you ready?"
0xE5DF63A8

0xDB06C2B2
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
0x7F06A331
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
0xBB625A78
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
0xF2E9FBC9
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
0x184E3676
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
0xCF2E32EC
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
0x6B593F4A
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
0xDFAA2980
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
0x0C0A8D28
and flashing eyes.
0x4CD5CD6B

0xDB06C2B2
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
0x51455445
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
0xCEA356EA
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
0x32AF151C
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
0xA70D8481
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
0xBC0E5842
seemed breasting and resisting.
0x8D8AD195

0xDB06C2B2
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
0x296D563A
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
0xB242DCB1
me, Jane."
0x62350754

0xDB06C2B2
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
0xD5624F1F
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
0xE2CB6EDF
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
0x955E6D16
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
0x3178C60D
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
0x300FE079
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
0xFCBE6846
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
0x384260F2
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
0xB9A232A8
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
0x54EAEB07
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
0xF598F0B6
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
0x1F6EBABB
path to the porch.
0x938C1433

0xDB06C2B2
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
0xD24CDC0B
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
0xBA5B388C
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
0x6F87219A
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
0x86E7F6DE
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
0xBC5E8C46
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
0x84313CF6
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
0x4610E9EA
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
0xE9310F1A

0xDB06C2B2
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
0x38E694B7
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
0x38EBF0C1
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
0xBB94B73F
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
0x7119828B
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
0x1C93FB28
Rochester, went on.
0xC2FB6856

0xDB06C2B2
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
0xE14EB0E4
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
0xE4FE4AD0
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
0xC17C58FC
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
0x28355F49
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
0x8812B377
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
0xFFAEFB0B

0xDB06C2B2
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
0x959783A8
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
0xF47C4A47
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
0xE06FF0FF
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
0x9EBDB092
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
0x47C552FC
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
0x16D9C09D

0xDB06C2B2
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
0xE6241FA8

0xDB06C2B2
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
0xAF58EAF1
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
0x2A47291D
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
0x22879D5F
said, "Proceed."
0x224A49E3

0xDB06C2B2
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
0x4B915778
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
0xBBFD3500

0xDB06C2B2
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
0x1A81C30E
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
0x008E37AF

0xDB06C2B2
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
0x783515AB
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
0x86E9D649
marriage exists."
0xBAA18563

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
0x92B5543F
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
0xF4CE09BA
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
0xB9BFF41B
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
0x05381070
beneath!
0x805CB910

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
0xD01361AB
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
0x94B687BC

0xDB06C2B2
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
0x5ABA6541
advisedly."
0x5344F56E

0xDB06C2B2
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
0xB930FAC4
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
0xDC00488C

0xDB06C2B2
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
0xE42B9110
Rochester has a wife now living."
0xE4E01E8D

0xDB06C2B2
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
0xDAB9453A
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
0x535592CA
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
0xFC85FB62
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
0xC5124617
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
0xC95EBA52
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
0x385B7256
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
0x5F84D43F
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
0x43028D59

0xDB06C2B2
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
0x545E7189

0xDB06C2B2
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
0x7AD0E185

0xDB06C2B2
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
0xC9483B2B

0xDB06C2B2
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
0xEC769725
recognises, if you do not."
0xF81AAF00

0xDB06C2B2
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
0x598D1189
place of abode."
0x106227C7

0xDB06C2B2
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
0x8C8DDA8B
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
0x98BEE14D

0xDB06C2B2
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
0x41923689
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the
0x16183009
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
0x5E59F07A
to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant,
0xB5208DFC
and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town,
0xFE55B92E
Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of
0x2F3C3DEF
that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.  Signed, Richard
0xF673A177
Mason.'"
0xED11B8FF

0xDB06C2B2
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
0xF2E6B104
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
0x68E1DA80

0xDB06C2B2
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
0x65DC4D42

0xDB06C2B2
"How do you know?"
0xCA730E09

0xDB06C2B2
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
0xED740129
scarcely controvert."
0x60F61D2F

0xDB06C2B2
"Produce him--or go to hell."
0x5C5FF4D3

0xDB06C2B2
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
0x6C5CDD9D
goodness to step forward."
0x6F53EDA1

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
0x17E04D62
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
0xD5E13B99
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
0x4F5A622F
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
0xE3A93E1D
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
0xB7E5D777
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
0x5AF02A93
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
0xF3F84B04
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
0x7888E370
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
0x3995A0B7
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
0x0BCF0621
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
0xF0ACC978
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
0x97201796
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
0x2CD36F46
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
0x5BB1BDC5

0xDB06C2B2
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
0x266FC215

0xDB06C2B2
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
0x03874B4C
what have you to say?"
0x6A8ED800

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
0xD28D8FE8
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
0x5BA368BA
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
0x698AB707

0xDB06C2B2
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
0x0816114E

0xDB06C2B2
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
0x65F47C49
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
0x6827FA29

0xDB06C2B2
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
0x96F9ED27
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
0x20AEF85F
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
0xE3BF79FC

0xDB06C2B2
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
0x9062EA9D

0xDB06C2B2
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
0xC96D275F
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
0x342FA35B
formed his resolve, and announced it--
0x0F4D0290

0xDB06C2B2
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
0xDAAEC5E1
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
0xC5CC1BD6
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
0xE1614050
obeyed.
0x0F0973FE

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
0x3210275C
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
0xA0877910
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
0x7779C536
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
0x68F90C4D
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
0xDA105A4C
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
0xB0F58861
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
0x85E50CEE
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
0xFC8DCABB
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
0x4786B6B9
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
0xC8A3F515
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
0x513687C5
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
0x3B43B849
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
0x3B305F2A
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
0xBB2F3B7B
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
0xA42AC163
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
0x42F395FA
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
0x843B95B0
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
0x9E40057C
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
0x8F47E14A
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
0xF4C57835
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
0xF8656360
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
0x0454A4A5
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
0x48736374
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
0x546AE236
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
0x96AAEDE8
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
0x2128E393
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
0x110C58DF
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
0x9793C32B
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
0xE6F5D648
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
0x01515C71
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
0x5CCE0F8F
you--follow!"
0x74CFF5D3

0xDB06C2B2
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
0x789BFB91
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
0xBB11648D

0xDB06C2B2
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
0x021831E6
will not be wanted to-day."
0x1CF0F9EC

0xDB06C2B2
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
0xDF4B5806
greet us.
0x526344DA

0xDB06C2B2
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
0x188F916C
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
0x516E1775
late!"
0x29F31245

0xDB06C2B2
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
0x608CEA33
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
0x43B0E3EA
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
0x8E7F3068
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
0xE04DDA0B
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
0xBE0E3010

0xDB06C2B2
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
0xFDFCBF37
here."
0x075F04DA

0xDB06C2B2
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
0x129A20E9
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
0x79673723
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
0x8E0F2F01
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
0x13E11CA1
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
0x3D29E0AD
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
0x0B6726BA
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
0xF203BAB6
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
0xFB95AA15
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
0xF594FAB4
mane, hid its head and face.
0x06998BDC

0xDB06C2B2
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
0xCBC11E51
your charge to-day?"
0xA0517924

0xDB06C2B2
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
0x40742114
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
0xDFC7C9C9

0xDB06C2B2
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
0x93256E65
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
0xF05F9A87

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
0x9AEF8B82

0xDB06C2B2
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
0x920B1C49

0xDB06C2B2
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
0x1A2672B6

0xDB06C2B2
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
0xE89553CD
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
0xB10AFEFD
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
0x16534D57

0xDB06C2B2
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
0xD0F76E32
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
0x16988996

0xDB06C2B2
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
0x49231295
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
0x8F71986E

0xDB06C2B2
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
0x00FE7849

0xDB06C2B2
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
0xAD021D12

0xDB06C2B2
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
0xDD2DE751
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
0xE9D8CC77
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
0x5A627468
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
0xEC4E5534
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
0xCEEE1B73
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
0xD04A40EF
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
0xA1EBB558
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
0xFE59C4FF
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
0xCE5C2CD2
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
0xA4058E34
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
0x080A2BE9
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
0x057687D4

0xDB06C2B2
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
0xA93AB96D
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
0xDD7745EF
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
0xFDAFA667
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
0x5DDCD41A
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
0x249E0E46
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
0xD14FF43A
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
0xCBEA04C0
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
0x37CF435F
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
0x29341746
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
0xD2511ABB

0xDB06C2B2
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
0xC2D69C72
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
0xCDD30B96
the stair.
0x84B96E73

0xDB06C2B2
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
0xD382D1D9
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
0x30DC8CC3
returns to Madeira."
0x14F2F37B

0xDB06C2B2
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
0x62586C7A

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
0x0B77A669
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
0x25AD7BA9
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
0x055004C6
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
0x296293E4
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
0x9280D897
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
0x1E4D1233
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
0xDCFD5254
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
0x353D3280
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
0x477F711B
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
0x47414F4E
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
0xD1F312C6
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
0x5E21FDE1
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
0x5DD16EC9
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
0x7F412A96
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
0xD1AEBCD2
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
0xDB5DDF1D
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
0x3574290B
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
0xC9887BBE
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
0x6013E29C

0xDB06C2B2
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
0xD3DEE0F7
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
0x13D8DDD6
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
0x60ECF1D9
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
0x4D2E02E8

0xDB06C2B2
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
0x49CA452F
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
0x1C4B9E05
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
0x55C124BF
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
0xDBEB8759
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
0x10CAE8D9
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
0xBC216146
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
0xC29DB956
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
0xD4E57A02
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
0x800AF920
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.

0xDB06C2B2
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
0xFB8B2086
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
0xDB0A5075
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
0xEC398911
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
0x7838E0B5
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
0xFC8D8601
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
0x5F3A0F9A
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
0x5F68D34F
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
0xFA7683A7

0xDB06C2B2
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
0x3D796715
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
0xE6D8447D
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
0xFFB558E8
prospects?
0x3AC8850A

0xDB06C2B2
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
0x7C2FDDD5
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
0x08EF8A04
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
0x518210EA
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
0x914520F0
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
0x011ACFE8
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
0xAA61EC07
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
0xC2CDE06F
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
0xFF28EC36
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
0xB016069F
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
0xF95465A8
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
0x1251E644
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
0x51B27CEF
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
0x07E48DF1
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
0xD24F89CA
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
0x463203BC
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
0xDCE36093
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
0x2FC534B1
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
0x26ED0FE9
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
0x2F188D14
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
0x62BC2988
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
0x81677372
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
0x2B923FAB
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
0x6C4DF1B4
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
0xD409A640
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
0x8B0CB5B0
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
0x64BC9C8C
conduct!
0x6F849396

0xDB06C2B2
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
0xA982FCFB
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
0x99936A04
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
0x49FB2915
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
0x33E257A5
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
0x19E96D44
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
0xBFA3BFD1
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
0x46EB60C0
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
0x2DA95D65
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
0x6CF7935B

0xDB06C2B2
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
0x08921E07

0xDB06C2B2
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
0x9749ED52
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
0x14DB775D
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
0x8FE70D89
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
0x2040C3C4
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
0x02436BF7
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
0xA86C5163
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
0xD5DA2C64
floods overflowed me."

CHAPTER XXVII
0xF2C3D613

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
0xD4041FAF
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
0x446989C2
"What am I to do?"
0x646BAEBA

0xDB06C2B2
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
0x6FBD3C2D
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
0xE31D5AD0
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
0x11BA7985
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
0x505FE5F9
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
0xB5C1FD5B
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
0x60303B24
cannot do it."
0x74B8F492

0xDB06C2B2
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
0x57705D02
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
0x113AE569
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
0xBDDE26AA
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
0x78D66A6C
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
0x92E2866D
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
0xCD387548
depths of agony.
0x31B4AF93

0xDB06C2B2
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
0x25979216

0xDB06C2B2
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
0x2D019227
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
0x37D465AA
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
0xDCA1E6DC

0xDB06C2B2
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
0x0FD8A0EF
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
0x9F654D68
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
0xDC3F7B87
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
0x861CC3DB
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
0x057E39D1
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
0xFC674671
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
0x513994AB
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
0xDA8AE1F9
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
0xDB4B2BC8
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
0x2DE692DA
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
0x6C7BC770
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
0xAE00351C
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
0xDAE44B51
threshold.
0x2B52C8F1

0xDB06C2B2
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
0x5A7D8925
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
0xF7D1B737
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
0x7ECE0450
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
0xAF2B2FDC
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
0x1AEB9812
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
0x9BC925ED
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
0xA3871C77
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
0xFA5BE0BC
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
0x4277C7B9
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
0xF4B4FCA4

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
0x40E0D5C4
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
0xFBE2BB30
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
0xB51E9905

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
0x33863045
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
0x59A9BBE3
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
0x96EF5533
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
0x402A88FD
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
0xD27D3625

0xDB06C2B2
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
0x9F7027E9
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
0x13DEC4CD
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
0xC913761F
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
0xDD0BB1E3
heart's core.
0x076DA405

0xDB06C2B2
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
0xA4D0F516
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
0x989BDBA1
the result rather of weakness than of will.
0xF2D313FA

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
0xF5731C2C

0xDB06C2B2
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
0xB639F041
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
0xF0700DAA
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
0xF5C961EF
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
0x51D25F14
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
0x38D57DE1
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
0x94D4DF53
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
0xFC234242
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
0x81C7B1A4
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
0x11C713F3
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
0x7B66FE52
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
0x61047A63
him."
0x50126532

0xDB06C2B2
"How are you now, Jane?"
0x8EE583EE

0xDB06C2B2
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
0xA91486D7

0xDB06C2B2
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
0xDB52D1D7

0xDB06C2B2
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
0x3D1D841A
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
0xE179A984
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
0xC2BE66B5
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
0x01AD0BE0
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
0x9C08218F
put his aside.
0x69B59BD0

0xDB06C2B2
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
0xF6E42502
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
0xD2F48B5B
appropriated?"
0xC137DAAF

0xDB06C2B2
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
0x8069D23C

0xDB06C2B2
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
0x9F8DE5F8
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
0x86ECF5A1
rightly?"
0xCADF159D

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
0xF59DBB4A
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
0x98AFE233
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
0xFC32BE76
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
0x0BDF1A07
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
0xA8E962E7
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
0x1E5D6920
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
0x4038BE59
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
0xC9264146
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
0x4AF20AA5
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
0xEA23D325
know you--I am on my guard."
0xFAF76397

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
0xE0E58EC3
warned me to curtail my sentence.
0x98773DC4

0xDB06C2B2
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
0xC8EB8994
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
0x3F0260EF
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
0x7AFE1037
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
0x935DC9F8
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
0x566D7E80
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
0xFFE8D007
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
0xF961848A
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."
0xDA8F81DC

0xDB06C2B2
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
0xAAC4E2BE
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
0x8B835714
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
0x05E71878
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."
0x20B3C52F

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
0x4467CA3F
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
0xF884970D
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
0xC99B1BD3
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
0xA01D6ED9
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
0x7DE55EE9
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
0x95AB230E
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
0x9D4935FE
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
0x51D9FF9D
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
0xEEDFA94A
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
0xE4B0262C
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
0xD209C72D
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
0x1F1F794A
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
0x9525F623
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
0xEA24E16B
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
0x61E511DB
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
0x3B069A58
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
0x72C71B64
assassination, even of what I most hate.
0xD92BA54C

0xDB06C2B2
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
0xFD8DA96B
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
0xEE285544
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
0xCE2A2268
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
0xECBBA10E
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
0x5472A137
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
0x7E115B20
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
0xBBA747DF
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
0x50F7BA81
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
0x08E4B169
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"
0x8833452E

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
0xA8721012
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
0xB1B7B004
cannot help being mad."
0xA9343A76

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
0x00488A18
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
0xB3B97885
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
0x3E7104DB

0xDB06C2B2
"I do indeed, sir."
0xE136843A

0xDB06C2B2
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
0xBAA86BB9
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
0x1AF0F021
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
0x3DF4E496
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
0x4A03B8D6
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
0xC7D7137A
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
0x0FC82613
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
0x2863CF1E
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
0x4CEF4FD7
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
0x618CC2BA
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
0xCED4EA7F
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
0xF87D70CC
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
0x5D8D20ED
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
0xA8137A9A
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
0x086EFD52
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
0xEC9220DB
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
0xD931A67A
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
0x891E522A
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
0xF9D0FEED
falsehood and slander."
0x0B21A9A5

0xDB06C2B2
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
0xA6F67931
for you."
0xF93A131A

0xDB06C2B2
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
0x2CC99823
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
0x167B954E
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
0xAAD8905B
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
0x3B136784

0xDB06C2B2
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
0xF271C69A
too dull for you."
0xFA106C3C

0xDB06C2B2
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
0xEF1C8813
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
0x67EA6132
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
0xB00628B1

0xDB06C2B2
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
0xD25CBF88
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
0x8C0B2C66
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
0x70D79770
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
0x23248F31
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
0x0F6B72E9

0xDB06C2B2
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
0xACF5AB51
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
0xDE2A02F0
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
0xBB3F7A44
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
0xA221B53A
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
0x131308DA
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
0x5912443A

0xDB06C2B2
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
0x5C0AF9FD
before me.
0x599ADA90

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
0x147C12EF
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
0x54722577
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
0x773CC75E
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
0xB68C7531
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
0xAB696DAB
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
0xF5B966AB
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
0xF50E78B5
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
0xBE03A898
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
0x40B302D4
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
0x8FA955A1
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
0x9CDB96FA
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
0x1189A831
soothingly--
0x041B355F

0xDB06C2B2
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
0xE33A5EE0
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
0x7581987B

0xDB06C2B2
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
0x07A5ADC7
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
0xEB1A7ADB
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
0xD4E0BE7F
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
0xD341FFD7
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
0x5124AAE9
heartily.
0x14919028

0xDB06C2B2
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
0xF8325108
not while he was in such a passion.
0x5EF0D40C

0xDB06C2B2
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
0x0F13B93A
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
0x10FB7A87
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
0x70741E84

0xDB06C2B2
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
0x64C6D56A
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
0xCE179072
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
0x6E13C244

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
0x0A07AA82
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
0x5FFDE07E
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
0x35BBB33C
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
0xA03940E2
were some toad or ape."
0x859C2D7F

0xDB06C2B2
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
0x5AF5FEEC
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
0xB8326EE5
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
0xEFAEE478
where I had wounded.
0x7D2A65E1

0xDB06C2B2
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
0xF2D3E64D
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
0x4877E323

0xDB06C2B2
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
0xBA34A43C
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"
0xA06BE04F

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
0x8F48256E
one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."
0x89FBF728

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, mention it!  If I storm, you have the art of weeping."
0x47000E08

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester, I must leave you."
0x4402DC08

0xDB06C2B2
"For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which
0xBE2DDC26
is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?"
0x93346125

0xDB06C2B2
"I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole
0x1DAB0900
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
0xC48F0886
scenes."
0x144A9BA4

0xDB06C2B2
"Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting
0x7DA8BA8A
from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new
0x87F58F2A
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
0xF359EFE9
You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep
0xC5BD5DEC
only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in
0xF1E169EA
the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
0x398855E4
Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
0xF2114CE7
innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make
0xF4243189
you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be
0xE1D48CC3
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."
0x2B049CA0

0xDB06C2B2
His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
0x77DD4B62
still I dared to speak.
0xC89610BF

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
0x4F80F997
yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
0x5C68DF35
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false."
0x48B8BEBE

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long-
0x024AEC44
enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and
0x76FB7783
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!"
0x9F82D84C

0xDB06C2B2
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
0xA7FA2BC0
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
0x023B08EB
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
0x96F9E17D
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
0xE5024806
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher
0x49A3352B
than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.
0x2D56F8CB

0xDB06C2B2
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  "I keep telling her I am
0xAEF94377
not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing
0x092AA534
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
0x7DB20168
infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
0xFF8CCEFE
opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,
0x8113A332
Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
0x649E3C6B
you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
0x092D269C
case.  Can you listen to me?"
0xE6F4EB7C

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."
0xE2B37567

0xDB06C2B2
"I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
0x4693F58B
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
0x9F5C0970

0xDB06C2B2
"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."
0x70A28682

0xDB06C2B2
"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"
0xF6039E1A

0xDB06C2B2
"I have understood something to that effect."
0xCD37A303

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
0x48579478
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
0xAA2E5999
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
0x785BD348
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
0x185CA1A2
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
0x32926789
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
0x292D70C6
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
0x15A809F3
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
0x627E3C52
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
0xF2BDAA18
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
0xC73F781F
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
0xA20DE9DD
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
0xD35F5059
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
0x1C686B00
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
0xBF40B13D
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
0xECD9DDDE
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
0x460975EB
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
0x5FE3312E
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
0x1C85DAA7
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
0x73AD37D8
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
0xBD9BF959
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
0x39C6B1EA
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
0x987AC4EC
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
0xF05795FA
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
0xDA6B3189
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
0x61EE707C
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
0x0EFC1C9F
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
0x8ABAB202
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
0x55CE35B0
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
0x03AF58A1
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
0x12904A28
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
0x98D19DE4
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."
0xB60216DE

0xDB06C2B2
"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The
0x81A681D1
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
0x53BCA345
lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot.
0x44DF4603
The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor
0xB28E2DBC
all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble
0x81785A71
mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
0x3C1CC503
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
0x73B2E411
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
0xF2EDA540
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
0x323AAB3B
plot against me."
0x3D4719C7

0xDB06C2B2
"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
0x42AB9F55
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
0x06A7E049
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
0xB869E88C
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of
0x90F8C2D5
being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found
0xF112CBCF
that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day
0xA003C43A
with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
0x5DDF3EA2
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from
0x0492EE01
her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I
0x6B3D94B7
perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
0xEFD644EC
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
0xD0AC493F
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
0x5988DB7D
exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
0x7355EFD3
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
0xB6E72692
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.
0xCBDCD8B7

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
0x0B7E9A6F
shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
0x84A8C6AB
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
0x7A35E133
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
0x45763C26
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
0x2E4EE952
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
0xB1B6E5D0
propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on
0x3BE266A6
me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me
0xB2F8BCC0
through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man
0x24CFE1E9
bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.
0x1AE89D46

0xDB06C2B2
"My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my
0xBCB198BA
father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a
0xE549481C
nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with
0x5FCECEF0
mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not
0x9FACC7DB
rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered
0xB79DCA73
that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs
0x87FD3CC5
of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost
0xB371216D
sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?"
0x915E7D9F

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you."
0x2230DA1A

0xDB06C2B2
"Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,
0x0D05FC38
which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer
0xC30A5FBA
it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is
0x554F5559
a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant
0x942BFF75
contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,
0x95BE2C44
Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this
0x8C1972A5
moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your
0xC34DDAF2
heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,
0x46BD2DAC
my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very
0xFF0F3D37
natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter
0xA4994FCD
have free advent--my arms wait to receive her."
0x44558EF9

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"
0x73D1C94B

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
0x090259D2
all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I
0xB73E712B
was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in
0x227B5DE9
my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
0x1D2D62D9
crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.
0x91C83F8D
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and
0x09B08637
heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I
0xDAC2E36C
breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that
0x77A877B8
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
0x8390187A
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
0x0A08D79E
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
0x422E1EE5
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
0xF7A55BA2
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
0xCDA7C6CE
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.

pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery

0xBDC75B5C
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
0x9EFEAFE0
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
0x48AC5779
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
0xAB6184F5
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
0xBC0E4E04
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
0xE7D03ECB
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
0xF6F34362
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
0x409B9064
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
0xC1E0FA06
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
0xB6C40C94
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
0xCEBA3BF2
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
0x0E7B9AED
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
0x953F82AD
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.

"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open

0x32816F13
I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.  From a flowery arch
0xFAC5541F
at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the

"'Go,' said Hope, 'and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a

0x27052854
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
0xD086E1E3
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
0x5032BE1D
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
0xADC930D1
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
0x4B8AC9B1
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish

0xCB10E013
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a

0x5CB4B254

At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the

0x1134435C
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
0x87E0452A
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
0xA62F6DE3
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
0xB9E28035
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
0x5BA9A3B8
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
0x133BD11D
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
0xFCFFD781
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
0x47DBA0A6
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
0x31D9EC47
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
0x7440B954
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
0x624C7A40
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the
0x351277F6
thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet
0x59F6BAEE
visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--"
0xED3141E8

0xDB06C2B2
"And what, sir," I asked, while he paused, "did you do when you had
0xFD7B235F
settled her here?  Where did you go?"
0xA1E6F663

0xDB06C2B2
"What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.
0x143D2576
Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
0x0206CACA
March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
0xF8AA2789
lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
0x34051D06
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--"
0x4CC75217

0xDB06C2B2
"But you could not marry, sir."
0x0A949C95

0xDB06C2B2
"I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not
0x15E59FAE
my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to
0xE20B81F7
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me
0x17891D84
so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be
0x50B187F0
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to
0x6E971054
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was
0x4ED5391D
burdened."
0x25A368E3

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, sir?"
0x128BB394

0xDB06C2B2
"When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.  You open your
0xC8E79095
eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,
0x47FCA5E2
as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted
0x92792F1B
to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you
0x71C34C6B
mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;
0xD5B02D85
and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I
0x9EBDA0CE
don't very well know why."
0x61DBB5AE

0xDB06C2B2
"I mean,--What next?  How did you proceed?  What came of such an event?"
0x5CCAA7A7

0xDB06C2B2
"Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?"
0x12B0CFC6

0xDB06C2B2
"Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you;
0x61151ADF
and what she said."
0x6AA385BC

0xDB06C2B2
"I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her
0x9956A70E
to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.
0x91F93CBF
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
0xA98E964E
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
0x479D3421
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
0x41DE030C
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
0x10477BAA
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
0x74C3747D
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
0xEAF33D28
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
0x2A2C511C
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
0x1AA5CF4A
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
0x466FEFC7
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
0x2B0E0FDB
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
0x5437CA68
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
0xBAEC09A0
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
0x6C131DD5
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
0x4B45AE9C
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
0x1BAC87B3
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
0xAA528862
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
0x3DB2A6E6
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.
0x01BE8906

0xDB06C2B2
"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
0xBDC00057
The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a
0xE119085C
man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,
0x8ACCC30B
and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an
0x00800BCC
Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
0x1E50B1BE
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
0x2613BCBC
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
0x0D7D4543
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
0xF2A8B062
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
0x257CC963
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
0x2658ABD7
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
0x786893A1
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"
0xF1B3343A

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
0x39E5172D
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
0x053966B4
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
0xD9598AFF

0xDB06C2B2
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
0xF4D1F829
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
0x2C8292C3
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
0xA1E936CD
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
0x134F04DA
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
0xD79AF55E
Giacinta, and Clara."
0xAFA6E0D2

0xDB06C2B2
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
0x24A55234
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
0xAAEA54D9
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
0xA1B2CDAD
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
0x2F35C06D
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
0xC4E3B83E
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
0xCADF1845
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
0x6EB044D1
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
0x04B026DA

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
0x3304C256
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
0x7129924E
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
0x50C791B2
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
0xFC6E11BD
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
0xC7F04B7A
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
0x384FC0BE
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
0x1862427B
back to England.
0x207EC37A

0xDB06C2B2
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
0x35643370
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
0xA60CE3BA
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
0xD4854E4B
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
0x313D8763
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
0x7113E19B
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
0x04A9B9CB
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
0xB58E01DD
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
0x3852674E
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
0x91636484
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
0xCA7C717F
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
0xC22113BE
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.
0x3D0A280A

0xDB06C2B2
"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
0x50F23622
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
0xC8CA9156
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
0x5D62E4CF
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
0x3CEC18DD
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
0xF6121BE4
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
0x17333270
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
0xA2C43D8E
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
0x820DBFB1
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
0x9F947A3A
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
0x314F1188
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
0xF40202BB
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
0x1E94147B
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
0x593848DD
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
0xC964D136
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
0x40332145
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
0xB33E098B
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
0xEA98FAC1
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
0x6ED9CD0D
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
0x2E97729D
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
0x10705FBD
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
0xC2A3FA27
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
0xDECD7E1C
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
0x9A50749D
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
0xD3388DCF
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
0x9EE416FC
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
0x46A6B5E2
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
0x6EA7F80C
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
0x463EF968
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
0x9B87B642
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
0x922D6149
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
0x1B2C7815
out of my sight.
0x3AE443B2

0xDB06C2B2
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
0x43436DB2
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
0x00DD08DB
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
0xEA408CC8
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
0x933B132B
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
0x85E299EA
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
0x3FEB2EC6
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
0x129E3CAC
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
0x8DF5A6FF
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
0x6E74B95D
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
0x737CD252
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
0x3BA05B67
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
0xB61E3F01
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
0x11EC255B
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
0xDE3E88C5
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
0xA46A2AE9
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
0x0242A389
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
0x07DF938C
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
0x8CBAF896
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
0x4E28590F
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
0xE61F9329
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
0xBF26B060
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
0xE628094E
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
0xD3519EF1
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
0x6492D99B
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
0x1E1BB0F9
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
0x0BAA0FA2
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
0xC8328436
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
0x374870D5
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
0x425637C9
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
0x08F000B1
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
0xCFF504DE
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
0x952610A7
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
0xD294337D
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
0xA5316AF3

0xDB06C2B2
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
0x18589518
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
0x1B5CB17F
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
0x37C0F758
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
0x75C1D8B2
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
0x2AD61697
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
0xA7413B07
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
0x6E490110
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
0x01EBEDDF
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
0x74963AD8
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
0x8CCB0709
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
0xFF604071
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
0x971C1AC6
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
0x959ACA5A
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
0x88F2114F

0xDB06C2B2
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
0x59838E91
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
0xA7B3972E
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
0xAEABB8DD
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
0xF9F909D7

0xDB06C2B2
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
0x0AB81B31
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
0x7BC5F4A3

0xDB06C2B2
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.
0x2DFA1697

0xDB06C2B2
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
0x347C3153
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
0x4F14DC7D
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
0x21702CD9
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
0x928F0524
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
0x965A2F34
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
0xCDB5F358
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
0x73D07339
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
0xEACB00FA

0xDB06C2B2
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
0xCFC604E7
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
0x830DF5F3
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
0x939BF3F4
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
0x22DB8650
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
0x7F165D44
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
0x25F7873D
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
0xC6259513
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
0x605BDF09
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
0xA037606D
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
0x64AFDB6F
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
0x2778088A
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
0xE0993411

0xDB06C2B2
A pause.
0x0246A264

0xDB06C2B2
"Why are you silent, Jane?"
0x1066B4E5

0xDB06C2B2
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
0xB8CD0585
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
0xE9BE2438
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
0x914622A2
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
0x95780E87
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
0x8D324CA7

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
0xBAA70C15
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
0xAEC2CB9C

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours."
0x819AC8EC

0xDB06C2B2
Another long silence.
0xC64A526D

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
0x5F9CC42E
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
0xCA0B76EA
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
0xCC39ACC3
and to let me go another?"
0x2EDDEEE6

0xDB06C2B2
"I do."
0x4FD4783E

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane" (bending towards and embracing me), "do you mean it now?"
0x6D8B87C8

0xDB06C2B2
"I do."
0x4FD4783E

0xDB06C2B2
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
0xC0050742

0xDB06C2B2
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
0xB6C9F38F

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
0x780298EE
to love me."
0xD9BAC6CD

0xDB06C2B2
"It would to obey you."
0x8852FFF9

0xDB06C2B2
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
0xAFC7614F
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
0xA7CE8777
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
0x8CC80B00

0xDB06C2B2
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
0x08084BDC
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
0xDBDB78CC
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
0x81D663A6
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a

0x68541F80

0xDB06C2B2
"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet

again there."
0x7E9EB5CD

0xDB06C2B2
"Then you will not yield?"
0xC7730109

0xDB06C2B2
"No."
0xBB39FC9B

0xDB06C2B2
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
0x2F05CFBB
rose.
0x7437BB19

0xDB06C2B2
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."
0x9DD6E38E

0xDB06C2B2
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
0x3C8C66AC
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
0x669C477F

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
0x55A40727
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
0x0EE3CC79

0x16F1684D

"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
0x5130FCDB
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
0x8F0DA5E8
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
0x26E0A1B4
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
0x35205F3A
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
0x7EF16A1A
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
0xC58A0F2B
by living with me?"
0x26848208

0xDB06C2B2
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
0x11552FCC
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
0xC3CBCB11
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
0x449727B2
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
0x150D0816
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
0x736FD1F8
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
0xB580DDEB
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
0x0AAB112A
who will be injured by what you do?"
0x09BCBA6D

0xDB06C2B2
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
0x3B178F45
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
0x650DCE9A
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
0x2B07DFCC
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
0x92E15182
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
0x465B751B
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
0x08786327
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
0xE97153D2
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
0x603D424E
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
0x4A3C7C78
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
0xEFAAA038
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
0x0FCE7FA0
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
0x815899FA
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
0x2A8F0DF4

0xDB06C2B2
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
0x724EDEC5
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
0x010454A8
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
0x51A2559D
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
0xB1E47002
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
0x7BE68648
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
0x26B57010
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
0x9632AD96
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
0xCB22C340
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
0x57BA2726
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
0xFAB3EEDC
strength almost exhausted.
0x2AB4CDD9

0xDB06C2B2
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
0x630D2C8A
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
0x8D2DB8E7
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
0x83C4CF3A
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
0xAA9716FB
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
0x64ADE8F2
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
0xFA03B2A8
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
0xF995BCC0
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
0x74678F88
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
0x5D1B0C66
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
0xEDF6CEE5
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
0x75857808
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
0xABF0F75B
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
0xE69D25D9
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
0x087A587C
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
0x1EAAFB15

0xDB06C2B2
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
0x3C5B6310
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
0xE994299F
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
0x1528375A
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
0x585B90EA

0xDB06C2B2
"You are going, Jane?"
0xB7211A98

0xDB06C2B2
"I am going, sir."
0x55F3A8E6

0xDB06C2B2
"You are leaving me?"
0xE8385A89

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
0xBA1596C4
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
0xE198BD7B

0xDB06C2B2
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
0x93A3938F
firmly, "I am going."
0x8522C355

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane!"
0x331CD95B

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester!"
0x517E8452

0xDB06C2B2
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
0x2A3178B1
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
0xBCED1A8A
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
0x956E184C

0xDB06C2B2
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
0x698254EB
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
0x779C3D9B
deep, strong sob.
0xE1858A65

0xDB06C2B2
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
0x46D3F962
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
0xD2CEBB81
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
0xB37AF4A1
hand.
0xC57CB6F0

0xDB06C2B2
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
0xA5677612
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to
0x180B9ABA
me."
0x5A1E593E

0xDB06C2B2
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
0x86AB26C6
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
0x963D5353
yes--nobly, generously."
0xE0520D0A

0xDB06C2B2
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
0xE4E6323D
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
0x3A2DC2C5
once quitted the room.
0x4CED76E3

0xDB06C2B2
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
0xB048195D
"Farewell for ever!"
0xB03E6090

0xDB06C2B2
* * * * *
0x3C8BA05A

0xDB06C2B2
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
0xB226C1BD
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
0xA9CCE676
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
0x61D69648
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
0xE9FED59A
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
0x5EF1F20F
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
0x93B9DD3A
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
0x9DF9A4A1
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
0xE51F4847
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
0x38777CD3
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
0x4E454B03
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
0xB480C5A6
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
0xD8AF0542
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
0xAD56FC7C
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
0xE6319BBC
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
0x196A7E3A

0xDB06C2B2
"My daughter, flee temptation."
0xD1C3C31B

0xDB06C2B2
"Mother, I will."
0xA57C2D41

0xDB06C2B2
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
0xDD08E8D4
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
0x83ED7981
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
0xD7AF6233
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
0x6FAC14C0
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
0xF584005D
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
0x46E74D10
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
0x702E6033
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
0x5666F2FB
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
0x48FF55C0
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
0x018F7259
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
0xEAB8E458
from my room.
0xD562F795

0xDB06C2B2
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
0x9787562A
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
0x07629F3B
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
0x5CCD47C1
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
0xAF584D71

0xDB06C2B2
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
0xE8547C24
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
0xBDB2DC03
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
0xBB06F1F7
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
0x951EE082
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
0xF1E7AF3E
to go in and to say--
0x1918BFF2

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
0xCC877D33
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
0xE5137454
this.
0xFE0233A3

0xDB06C2B2
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
0x620B9298
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
0x49ECA969
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
0x67C817C6
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
0x28101B17
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
0x1EDDEDB1
on.
0x5E748E6C

0xDB06C2B2
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
0x8DA2B0A7
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
0xB0504D36
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
0xE1831010
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
0x16D26BFD
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
0x9F7B92D7
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
0x8587F2A6
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
0x21F7ADEC
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
0xE782EAA7
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
0x6AACE5CE

0xDB06C2B2
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
0x167D304F
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
0xD2681EFC
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
0x36C49EF2
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
0xE483BDF6
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
0x7063FF46
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
0x987DAB60
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
0x90230767
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
0xA251E351

0xDB06C2B2
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
0x27D09BA2
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
0x221FA643
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
0x4F328891
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
0xD1D151BE
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
0xD8C7FDB6
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
0x28C68A0B
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
0xD979415D
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
0x203C8AAA
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
0x2C3C1AE6
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
0xF1432CC5
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
0x93184CCA
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
0x305F4D1C
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
0xB2538A6F
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
0x697BFB80
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
0x03A13039
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
0x0BB6F56C
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
0xDA10ACC7
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
0x3C94698D
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
0xFB1A5199
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
0x730A29FB
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
0x404A783A
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
0x5496303C
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
0xDD086D64
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
0xD2A36D0A
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
0xCF844041
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
0x0EFDE4D2
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
0x01CC565A
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
0x4E9D3D4E
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
0x3E6E53BB
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
0xF155AC8C
ever to reach the road.
0x31DD623C

0xDB06C2B2
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
0xB3682BF6
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
0xEB8BD975
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
0x8B41B5B2
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
0x116A9954
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
0xEADF9C12
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
0x7C0979B1
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
0x8FB38C35
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
0x348F569F

0xDB06C2B2
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
0x8EFDA0C0
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
0xD365A61C
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
0x3E83C693
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
0xAA4B5EEE
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

CHAPTER XXVIII
0x19F6F19F

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
0x353A3AF4
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
0x65FD5AF2
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
0x3DDB8C37
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
0xB4D94DFE
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
0xFFE91F49
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
0xF93137AB
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
0x99C8886A

0xDB06C2B2
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
0xBC747491
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
0x4E3903C0
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
0xF0582506
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
0xE2397B8D
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
0xCC4C1F03
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
0xD2CB5771
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
0xBB0045A8
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
0x7308F239
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
0xD998617F
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
0x1BEC8369
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
0x6BB553A6
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
0x59C3C763
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
0x9B9719CF
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
0x27EB095F
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
0x0518781C
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
0xA499B567
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
0x9661CDD2
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
0x6231C116
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
0x789F7E43
will seek her breast and ask repose.
0xBB11A33C

0xDB06C2B2
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
0xB4312429
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
0xADFEB1AA
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
0x4ABE2ED4
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
0xD93660D8
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
0xB0F5D3E1

0xDB06C2B2
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
0xBAFB6048
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
0x9CE346F2
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
0x75F7AB3E
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
0xC57FD6FD
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
0x6516E074
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
0xB2EDD515
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
0xF4A9E240
regained the faculty of reflection.
0x689A1AB2

0xDB06C2B2
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
0x3DEDF414
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
0x04D1C7B5
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
0x7AD1AB23
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
0x1F614D63
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
0x1555A7A0
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
0x392C0C2C

0xDB06C2B2
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
0x93B5C13D
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
0x897CCB07
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
0x7012FE11
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
0x0100FC70
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
0x1FD9ECCC
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
0x6EEDD614
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
0x377F9BFA
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
0x4A9CB35E
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
0x88ECD8B2
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
0xE98FB0C0
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
0x83ED5668
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
0x77ED11ED
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
0x5701CBF2
then chose my couch.

{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
0xFA467EA5

0xDB06C2B2
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
0x22252D1D
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
0x75A2399F
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
0xF31A97C7
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
0xE21337E0
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
0xD59B2B72

0xDB06C2B2
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
0xEEABC857
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
0x9F0D2311
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
0xDC9DEF8E
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
0x5EAD1944
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
0xEB0F8708
attempts to seek him.
0x1A7387A0

0xDB06C2B2
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
0x73AFB429
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
0x2D856409
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
0xB003D5D0
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
0xC1549AD0
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
0xB56825A2
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
0x26B3AE3D
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
0x4014BF4A
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
0x16CF6F1E
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
0x1538DB7D
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
0x5F4CCF26
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
0xBE803C6F
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
0x3BACBB20
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
0xBEED4196
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
0xAD0FFA28
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
0x85861456
sleep forgot sorrow.
0xE60EA9B7

0xDB06C2B2
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
0xCBF68CA1
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
0x8984AB03
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
0xA7B3F861
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
0x3A98D94A
looked round me.
0x2B05BAE2

0xDB06C2B2
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
0xB313C58B
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
0xD9FE7564
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
0x3D7A4A8D
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
0xF37BD7CC
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
0x84F5E3FC
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
0xD1225126
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
0xA6E048B4
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
0xF3320444
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
0xD9F45061
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
0xF975A072
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
0x5237234B
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
0x2B66D9B6
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
0xB4BA5015
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
0x458E6A0E
out.
0x09E12AC4

0xDB06C2B2
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
0xD2CAF916
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
0xAB86FF9C
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
0x4C233BA7
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
0x5D48BCC2
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
0xB038FCDF
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
0xB8DD940E
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
0x1039E684

0xDB06C2B2
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
0x073EBBDF
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
0x7F8653D0
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
0x538D6565
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
0x0E7CCF52
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
0x1C6D0A23
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
0x892082A0
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
0xB3C8D348
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
0x847F1C41
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
0xF7334318
like the rest.
0x48421C53

0xDB06C2B2
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
0xA01085A5
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
0xAAF9C871
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
0x0ABE5567
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
0x9A34CDD7
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
0x2C4323D8
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
0xA641AB1E
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
0x8675BF09
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
0x75434367
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
0x6FE74CF8
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
0xE99590EE
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
0xED61C1B0
would not; but I must try.
0x051E3332

0xDB06C2B2
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
0x7FA01902
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
0xCC324FFB
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
0x3DDB5B7B
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
0xF877C052
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
0x4BC7B3FD
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
0x255C5A02
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
0x5FBD458F
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
0x5F72C363
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
0x73622A4E
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
0x2E8D6FF1
the village?"
0x1650B821

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
0xF1CBC207

0xDB06C2B2
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
0x5462465C
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
0xAD716418
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
0xADE689B1
apply somewhere.  Where?
0x3CB6F725

0xDB06C2B2
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
0x9E2900BE
wanted?"
0x7027CBEC

0xDB06C2B2
"Nay; she couldn't say."
0x6C91E4F6

0xDB06C2B2
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
0x6D562D92
do?"
0x653F166B

0xDB06C2B2
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
0xBACC9FAC
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
0x9AC76DE5

0xDB06C2B2
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
0xB2CAB769

0xDB06C2B2
"Nay; it was men's work."
0x9EB0A957

0xDB06C2B2
"And what do the women do?"
0x37F39322

0xDB06C2B2
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
0x2FE180DE
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
0xFAB123D9

0xDB06C2B2
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
0x22571141
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
0xBDE6773A
wanted.  I took leave.
0x8BD79A27

0xDB06C2B2
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
0xB114983A
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
0x4B54CC07
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
0xC30DBF78
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
0x13ED2314
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
0xFCFCD0E1
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
0x0CEE26F7
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
0x3D7BAB7E
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
0x17D68BC1
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
0x101883A7
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
0x43501FF1
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
0x712DC692
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
0xABA6D931
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
0x965FC35E
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
0x4D084B8E
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
0xF7BA4D69
if a servant was wanted here?
0x1389E897

0xDB06C2B2
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
0x2F58BBC0

0xDB06C2B2
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
0xC39B601D
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
0x60BE7DB8
no matter what."
0xC3E73CF6

0xDB06C2B2
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
0x37CA69C9
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
0x0234BECE
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
0x1C484E2D
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
0x3649BB09
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
0x6374F47C
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
0x6AA43358

0xDB06C2B2
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
0x871A4EFC
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
0x822C4E27
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
0xBB8ABDDD
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
0xCE432BBD
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
0x7E651991
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
0xD17CA955
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
0x895973A1

0xDB06C2B2
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
0x06E3CEFE
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
0x1A1CE35B
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
0xA0D7E9DC
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
0x0A02D810
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
0x0100D3C7
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
0x5953A890
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
0xADFF14A3
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
0xFAED15E4
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
0xD24EE632
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
0x5568F7B1
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
0x56B48F6C
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
0x25E58BD7
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
0xF754AF45
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
0x3875C30E
this the parsonage?
0x2BDB69C8

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"Was the clergyman in?"
0xDD6920A3

0xDB06C2B2
"No."
0xBB39FC9B

0xDB06C2B2
"Would he be in soon?"
0x89A08576

0xDB06C2B2
"No, he was gone from home."
0x1FFEEDA5

0xDB06C2B2
"To a distance?"
0x01BD41A7

0xDB06C2B2
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
0xA3104177
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
0xD223ADC1
there a fortnight longer."
0xAD48CE26

0xDB06C2B2
"Was there any lady of the house?"
0xF3A245DA

0xDB06C2B2
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
0xB4CE3E1B
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
0x2B40C2D4
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
0x8915FDF9

0xDB06C2B2
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
0x2DCDFDED
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
0x27048B61
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
0xEA2EF7F8
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
0x66C7A94E
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
0xAD941259
for this handkerchief?"
0xAED3C90F

0xDB06C2B2
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
0xC0137180
that way."
0x723B7C1E

0xDB06C2B2
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
0x698A162C
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
0x670D4A85

0xDB06C2B2
"Would she take my gloves?"
0x5F711600

0xDB06C2B2
"No! what could she do with them?"
0x8794A7E6

0xDB06C2B2
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
0x16353965
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
0x004368B0
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
0xF0387020
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
0x01A8908C
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
0x781E0E98
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
0x26E2E30A
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
0x23365399
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
0x78747061
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
0xE52258CF
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
0xF58B1074
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
0x01E71AAD
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
0xAB0DC25A
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
0x5F575994
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
0x654F59BA

0xDB06C2B2
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
0xCDD5E3C1
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
0x9B1A8200
said--
0xF0D0D532

0xDB06C2B2
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
0xD8D1974F
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
0xA468AFCD
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
0x33EB5F1A
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
0x9F065E03
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
0xE91B6CF7

0xDB06C2B2
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
0xFC99EEC5
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
0xA238F51D
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
0xF94E7079
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
0x102E074F
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
0x752D3FA2
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
0xD5C5957C
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
0xAC869C2D
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
0x87412104
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
0x4FDBA49D
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
0x2F1D82CC

0xDB06C2B2
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
0x53A9E79E

0xDB06C2B2
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
0xE3E59DC6
give her these porridge."
0x54421B97

0xDB06C2B2
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
0x895BA807
pig doesn't want it."
0xE36A0B2B

0xDB06C2B2
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
0x76DFC267
ravenously.
0x1611C566

0xDB06C2B2
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
0x75180B03
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
0xDB6DB4B9

0xDB06C2B2
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
0xA5D294DA
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
0x73F9F11D
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
0x8F585E25
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
0xF10A327C
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
0x3867BADA
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
0x7C236B2B
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
0x82E3A80E
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
0xCE5DB1C5
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
0x436BDD20
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
0xC9EF6253
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
0x653875A0

0xDB06C2B2
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
0x3360B410
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
0x600ED66F
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
0x472AFB0D
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
0x47995949
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
0x3C67EC53
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
0xCB1D03CA

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
0x59E55309
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
0x38982DC5
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
0xC37C6DD7
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
0xBFFEB1CD
grave."
0x9E94743C

0xDB06C2B2
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
0xBD39496E
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
0x1B96F5B3
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
0x1CEC1591
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
0xA9ABA6B2
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
0xBE501261
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
0x815FFE5D
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
0x97B19E31

0xDB06C2B2
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
0x9BDF50E1
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
0x24D65DBA
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
0xDB25FBA5
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
0xC5E79D52
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
0xD7C17894
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
0x4113DAB3
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
0xE55F0DA3
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
0x2E330C93
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
0xD041EB9C
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
0xA61B6952
it shut in my face."
0x86BC4420

0xDB06C2B2
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
0xB959AA0B
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
0xE3259398
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
0x2B051B94
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
0xBD56FAD5
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
0x88BBD54E
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
0x356952EE
long.
0xDB685A37

0xDB06C2B2
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
0x71FBCFA2
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
0x30E4F0AC
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
0x3780E5AC
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
0x629A78F9
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
0x9B070D0F
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
0x4870BCA3

0xDB06C2B2
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
0xEF105A55
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
0xF2C38A4D
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
0x9972F469
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
0x70054433
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
0xAF9ADA23
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
0xB8A30FC5
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
0xB4BB8A6C
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
0x401E7302
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
0x8003682D
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
0x187BFCC3
sable bush-holly or yew.
0x6BF8CD61

0xDB06C2B2
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
0xA07D147F
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
0x4BB8FA61
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
0x04D6C512
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
0x28D7A708
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
0x8160A2BC
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
0x04162D3E
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
0xC2952B69
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
0xB311996A
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
0xA0D727C7
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
0x9783AE13
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
0x00678F48
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
0xCAA20BFB
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
0x9C878A5C
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
0xCD6942BB
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
0x16F22185
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
0x44643C11
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
0x9C4293C6

0xDB06C2B2
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
0xE69CE73C
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
0x2D49D800
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
0xCAAE6AAB
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
0xB4D8326E
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
0xE742D1CB
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
0x8053CFA9
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
0x151E3D51
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
0xE34F568E

0xDB06C2B2
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
0x1A259135
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
0x61337168
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
0xCAAD192A
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
0xAFC9B03C
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
0xC55B32C4
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
0xB83055F4
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
0x782D5659
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
0xEF565B59
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
0xF32BE371
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
0xC0963DC9
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
0xF397157A
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
0xF101778A
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
0xE7FDCBD8
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
0xADAB7F8F
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
0x747FCE87
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
0x8438CC6E

0xDB06C2B2
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
0xCAB01A3A
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
0xF81FB0C7
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
0x0F11097E
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
0xF3E18F55
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
0x46CA9DC1
German I could not tell.
0x8158B574

0xDB06C2B2
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
0xB47E863D
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
0x793A0331
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
0xDB9BEAC0
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
0xB6338313
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
0x2628607C
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
0xA38E397A

0xDB06C2B2
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
0xBCF0B680
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
0xF8F71E51
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
0x8030B7E3
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
0x4527CA12
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
0x77C9B18D

0xDB06C2B2
Both were again silent.
0x926A3349

0xDB06C2B2
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
0xC2632365
looking up from her knitting.
0x5EEDBF7A

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
0xF7BE320E
other way."
0x74B44436

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
0x159D236D
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
0xDD52753A

0xDB06C2B2
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
0xC313DD61
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
0xA35C72C7
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
0x9BFBBC95

0xDB06C2B2
"And what good does it do you?"
0xE7FF139B

0xDB06C2B2
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
0xC6676446
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
0x30BBF831

0xDB06C2B2
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
0x80176978

0xDB06C2B2
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
0x24151C85

0xDB06C2B2
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
0xC52E587A
master but a lexicon."
0xBD96F644

0xDB06C2B2
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
0x42E10789
I wonder when St. John will come home."
0x656A66C5

0xDB06C2B2
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
0xEB9B9EA1
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
0x562D6D7E
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
0x7A17165E

0xDB06C2B2
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
0xAD34C563
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
0x2274A052

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
0xC875AA58
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
0x270CE067

0xDB06C2B2
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
0xD5C4A0CA
sad now.
0xFE64A67E

0xDB06C2B2
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
0x8F976156
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
0x2DE8F64E

0xDB06C2B2
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
0x0F2C3F6F

0xDB06C2B2
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
0x0D2C5339
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
0x68A9C946
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
0x43C7FE54
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
0x4786DF9D
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
0x648367C9
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
0x6C2EB1DA
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
0x488D648C
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
0x3C648DD9
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
0x3ADF4A1D
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
0x9A8DCA2F

0xDB06C2B2
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
0x9E74BBEA
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
0x885098D0
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
0x7863EFB9
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
0xA4827599
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
0x451E6251
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
0x8E46DFC3
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
0x05F72551

0xDB06C2B2
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
0x1A467FB2
St. John when he comes in."
0xB285B41B

0xDB06C2B2
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
0x9486DED6
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
0x381827DF
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
0x237D8EFE
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
0x614BB615
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
0x938CCC8C
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
0x58CCFE3F
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
0x99092F03
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
0x0C483B22
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
0x044286EE
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
0x07C2CCA7

0xDB06C2B2
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
0x7835A132
me by the light of the candle she held.
0x92CC5F34

0xDB06C2B2
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
0x389A1ED5

0xDB06C2B2
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
0x3D135796
from?"
0xE0B72F6A

0xDB06C2B2
"I am a stranger."
0xDFB4013F

0xDB06C2B2
"What is your business here at this hour?"
0xAF3C5BB6

0xDB06C2B2
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
0x0E118CA6
bread to eat."
0x091D9BBE

0xDB06C2B2
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
0x4324B882
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
0x9796AE0D
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
0xFA42292B

0xDB06C2B2
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
0xC7CB2459

0xDB06C2B2
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
0x1D4D02E9
now; it looks very ill."
0x4863826D

0xDB06C2B2
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
0x49C03706

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
0xC07D07CD
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
0xBD980852

0xDB06C2B2
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
0x9EE233DA
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
0x9060C2AA

0xDB06C2B2
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
0x0187F541

0xDB06C2B2
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
0x259BE5A3

0xDB06C2B2
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
0x968880D6
make such a noise.  Move off."
0x77D46C9C

0xDB06C2B2
"But I must die if I am turned away."
0x18B3C1A1

0xDB06C2B2
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
0x1F3559E2
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
0x5202BE4D
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
0x3A3FD412
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
0xA5FE9D58
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
0x698BA491
bolted it within.
0x5A84874B

0xDB06C2B2
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
0x8EBFB6BE
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
0xBF5063F4
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
0x22A9BBA2
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
0xD3F93EE2
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
0x97216DE4
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
0x5ABEFD16
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
0x4AC1D8FF
endeavoured to regain.
0xABFA67C4

0xDB06C2B2
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
0x2A239986
will in silence."
0x2E783F71

0xDB06C2B2
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
0xBD3C6BF9
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
0x170975E9
and still.
0xA58AF833

0xDB06C2B2
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
0xB01A22CD
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
0x6B844CED
if you perished here of want."
0x6A5E58BB

0xDB06C2B2
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
0x07A8C102
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
0x4BFB6D25
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
0xC4839A2B
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
0x78003609
to the door.
0x33726B89

0xDB06C2B2
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
0x36AFCFBC

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
0x688EF029

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
0x108204C4
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
0xD40E8997
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
0x6CDD4379
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
0x760E59E3

0xDB06C2B2
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
0x5E365462
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
0x464BFADC
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
0x58110495
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
0xF3848F54
house."
0x2E0E3D86

0xDB06C2B2
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
0x4D7A0EA6

0xDB06C2B2
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
0x55808435
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
0x44F3A894
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
0xF2BF0F30
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
0x70B79515
me.
0x23A34F09

0xDB06C2B2
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
0xCCE8FDAD

0xDB06C2B2
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
0xE6E5D7BE

0xDB06C2B2
"She does look white," said Hannah.
0x48F497AA

0xDB06C2B2
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
0xAA8A5B02
sit."
0xAD853506

0xDB06C2B2
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
0xE7491B10
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
0xEDEF5517

0xDB06C2B2
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
0x440638EE
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
0xF8A0F5C5

0xDB06C2B2
"A mere spectre!"
0x42292127

0xDB06C2B2
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
0xF171D493

0xDB06C2B2
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
0x5D42AAE6
bread."
0x6BDDDCF3

0xDB06C2B2
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
0x4FC8CD97
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
0x8989A3C4
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
0x8D7706CE
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
0x35AA68D6
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
0xF50BB70B

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
0x6CCC9BF0
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
0x2B33AFD1
first, eagerly soon.
0x24B71FF1

0xDB06C2B2
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
0x8126DB28
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
0xAC39AEEC

0xDB06C2B2
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
0x5F8F034E

0xDB06C2B2
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
0xE74E8C07
name."
0x9D116EDC

0xDB06C2B2
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
0x495C2662
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
0xA62D70A5

0xDB06C2B2
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
0xC8C8F304

0xDB06C2B2
I was silent.
0x877C8F80

0xDB06C2B2
"Can we send for any one you know?"
0x7DFFCC3E

0xDB06C2B2
I shook my head.
0x94F64E87

0xDB06C2B2
"What account can you give of yourself?"
0x454E4ACA

0xDB06C2B2
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
0xAFB1ABC7
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
0xDE4C6E33
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
0xA1C4050F
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
0x695F5D3E
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
0xDB748A86
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
0x779E4EB9

0xDB06C2B2
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."

0xDB06C2B2
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
0x36E7C167

0xDB06C2B2
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
0x0DA45588
took the word--
0xF2B44CD0

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
0xD0E47432
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
0x00D0BEE8

0xDB06C2B2
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
0x4968B784
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
0x8C0B83CE
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
0xF803B93F
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
0x69404D1D
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
0x17E56FAD
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
0x085F52D6
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
0x722A459E
silent.
0x45F7BDAF

0xDB06C2B2
"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
0xEFDA64AD
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
0x117D3977
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
0x798E649C
matter over."
0x50E379FE

0xDB06C2B2
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
0x4E7A0ED1
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
0xD3ADBF2A
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
0x4032709E
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
0xFF1DCFA6
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
0x36B2EC82
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
0xDF1842A4
joy--and slept.

CHAPTER XXIX
0x6F75B745

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
0x1C9384AA
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
0xB42E9E0C
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
0x73089B01
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
0xF5990051
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
0xEBA91F73
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
0xFCE58982
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
0xD1DDC9BA
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
0x936330BF
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
0x690E4569
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
0x2034DF1A
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
0x58D712D6
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
0x2E4203C5
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
0x9D06900A
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
0xFF02AD70
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
0xDCC0C14D

0xDB06C2B2
"It is very well we took her in."
0x0DB3685F

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
0xC4AD4B6C
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
0x42B19915

0xDB06C2B2
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
0xF52DF9E9

0xDB06C2B2
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
0x66EFD148
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
0xDC41160C
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
0xB3C887C4

0xDB06C2B2
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
0xF9E58F3A
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
0x8881F9CD
would be agreeable."
0xEE7F19F9

0xDB06C2B2
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
0xFA17BFCC
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
0x48EEF551
myself.  I was comforted.
0x37781749

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
0xB937B6E1
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
0x6C36BF33
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
0x6B3EF13E
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
0x6798B8E2
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
0x77DE84A3
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
0xAF4454F0
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
0x38DB91CA
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
0xE5658158
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
0x226389DE
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
0x2293838E

0xDB06C2B2
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
0x92727E1D
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
0x1C0B119F
her permanently."
0xDD128A08

0xDB06C2B2
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
0xD01166CA
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
0x9865D565
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
0x746747A0
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
0xC94DB4DC
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
0xCADA6FAD
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
0x3E5B1324

0xDB06C2B2
"She is so ill, St. John."
0x2845A439

0xDB06C2B2
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
0x33A3796A
are quite wanting in those features."
0x4765E2AB

0xDB06C2B2
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
0xE0DBED77
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
0xA4B59C91
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
0x8BB2EF1D
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
0x87129F6F
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
0x7C93399B
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
0xCD88B208
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
0xB0211DD6
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
0x0AD90561
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
0xEAF8D7E9

0xDB06C2B2
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
0x6B593C3A
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
0x779105CD
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
0xB74C4940
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
0xBFCC1A3E
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
0xBA59CC51
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
0x451E9238
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
0x3CFBEC32
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
0x0A6AC750
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
0x6F403858
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
0xBD4BED83
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
0x12B107A1
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
0x866C2285

0xDB06C2B2
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
0x215FC7A2
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
0x3E8DC3BC
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
0x18568901
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
0x77679153
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
0x14D8EDDE
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
0xB814C3CE
well-dressed, she even smiled.
0x6EE49435

0xDB06C2B2
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
0xE0E72CC4
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
0x4DB6B3A1

0xDB06C2B2
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
0x3D2C81ED
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
0x6C162EC8
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
0x23B05D2D

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
0xD3F52411

0xDB06C2B2
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
0xA79F6977
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
0x8CF6E116
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
0xC88945E1

0xDB06C2B2
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
0x7E785456
than yourself or your young ladies."
0xD095399F

0xDB06C2B2
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
0xD699244C
nor no brass, I guess?"
0xEFEFC4F0

0xDB06C2B2
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
0x3409F05B
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
0x9B884C7B

0xDB06C2B2
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
0x68654E32

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, very."
0x2C8DCBD2

0xDB06C2B2
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
0xEBFD761C

0xDB06C2B2
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
0x0B7B9657

0xDB06C2B2
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
0xC160FFF0

0xDB06C2B2
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
0x7966AE85
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
0x1BC06597
basket of the fruit.
0x7E3BC7F1

0xDB06C2B2
"Mak' 'em into pies."
0x3A9C9191

0xDB06C2B2
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
0x8875F40D

0xDB06C2B2
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
0xB3C16271

0xDB06C2B2
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
0x071B788D

0xDB06C2B2
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
0xF7B337C4
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
0x277CA7B3

0xDB06C2B2
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
0x0CA0C7B7
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
0xF4172BAD

0xDB06C2B2
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
0x6155EDE8
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
0x607FC135
are."
0x14F116FD

0xDB06C2B2
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
0x1EBCD730

0xDB06C2B2
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
0xD77E8762

0xDB06C2B2
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
0x9DDF2ECF
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
0x79B50C36

0xDB06C2B2
"That village a few miles off?
0xD1903845

0xDB06C2B2
"Aye."
0x741C312D

0xDB06C2B2
"And what is he?"
0xEA1597FA

0xDB06C2B2
"He is a parson."
0xC3C89967

0xDB06C2B2
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
0x2C3524E9
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
0x2BE472C3
residence?"
0x608E68DC

0xDB06C2B2
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
0x9EAC2111
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
0x6035BC7D

0xDB06C2B2
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
0x6557A9E7

0xDB06C2B2
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
0x508566C1

0xDB06C2B2
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
0x69673079

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"Their father is dead?"
0x84652A98

0xDB06C2B2
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
0xE35327D1

0xDB06C2B2
"They have no mother?"
0x1D5AE8AE

0xDB06C2B2
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
0x45E1D7D0

0xDB06C2B2
"Have you lived with the family long?"
0xBCE0BEA3

0xDB06C2B2
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
0xCD9726B4

0xDB06C2B2
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
0xA660FD07
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
0x7B608FAB
beggar."
0x132F1F16

0xDB06C2B2
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
0x72665754
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
0x92394520
goes about, you mun forgie me."
0xEF23AEF7

0xDB06C2B2
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
0x820106F0
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
0x50062E46

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'
0x3F496CA8
childer nor of mysel: poor things!  They've like nobody to tak' care on
0x2A961229
'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish."
0x015DB8B6

0xDB06C2B2
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
0x74B927E7

0xDB06C2B2
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
0xDB70E7FC

0xDB06C2B2
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
0xA920EBA7
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
0x6A2E7703
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
0xAB5911D9
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
0xF125C3C9
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
0x13FC0D26
to consider poverty a crime."
0xCABE1BF1

0xDB06C2B2
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
0x4CB6F5AE
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
0xBC1B7CC4
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
0xC4A8F485

0xDB06C2B2
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
0x7C353148

0xDB06C2B2
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
0xEA064B62
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
0x70DF5290

0xDB06C2B2
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
0xD9D3F979
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
0x47611E78
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
0xE85DE895
the young people.
0xB648E825

0xDB06C2B2
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
0x020432C3
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
0x899E70F2
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
0xAEE11AF1
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
0x22E29FB6
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
0xFBA7BA26
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
0xB6776A37
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
0xF5A61687
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
0x914D19BF
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
0x821E1B02
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
0x367A7D39
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
0xB928D940
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
0xB77D7EA2
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
0xEDAB0E8B
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
0xA3D32E6F
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
0xEB586532
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
0xEC4442F8
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
0x77AE08E3
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
0x7D03482A
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
0xA47069CD
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
0x902FF3DC
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
0x588FFE3C
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
0x2A0EE74D
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
0xB9260599
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
0xBFF16332
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
0x45CC6572
for being united.
0xCBC4A94F

0xDB06C2B2
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
0x554141BB
ladies and their brother were now.
0xC6B64EC6

0xDB06C2B2
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
0x5D4BBF06
to tea."
0xA5D6172B

0xDB06C2B2
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
0xFD71B1AD
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
0xBAD61091
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
0x30AD18D7
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
0x08183EE6
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
0x4373F2A7

0xDB06C2B2
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
0xCD9E16C9
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
0xB16292CC

0xDB06C2B2
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
0xA4BA8C90
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
0x3D7F9BEC
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
0x806B1810
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
0xA2DFAC48
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
0xFE960E14
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
0x8E8AAFA4
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
0xF721C088
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
0x08BC6FE3
will.
0xDED8885A

0xDB06C2B2
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
0x9680EA70
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
0xA1F40A5A
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
0x8BC35A65
parlour."
0x95646F09

0xDB06C2B2
"I am very well here."
0x68785D83

0xDB06C2B2
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
0x9B9CD41F

0xDB06C2B2
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
0x8078AEFA

0xDB06C2B2
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
0xF2A0EFF1
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
0xBE125C8F

0xDB06C2B2
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
0xDB285056
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
0xB538DF19
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
0x01FFC83A
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
0xD39EE252

0xDB06C2B2
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
0xED676277
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
0x68AFD9C7
parlour, and then its occupant.
0x814C6C18

0xDB06C2B2
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
0xFF96635F
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
0x6BDCAB06
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
0x988DE329
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
0x036AD3CD
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
0x9C92A2B8
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
0x54CA38A0
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
0x73330CCC
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
0x8ACAAA99
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
0xB9BB0EEA
and well saved.
0x089069BA

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
0x5ECFB050
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
0x2D5D13F9
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
0x232269D6
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
0x56F71D56
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
0x996A8062
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
0x67CD49AE
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
0x22BE90E5
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
0x3F35F4F0
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
0x3E5E882C
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
0x438E6EB1
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
0x3610575F
fair hair.
0xD5699206

0xDB06C2B2
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
0xC50AF5C6
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
0x1D908567
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
0x056F6E10
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
0x7AA7BCF2
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
0x30E7974F
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
0x9BDEF53D
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
0x6548005D
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
0xAB5A7E95
of the oven.
0x99F6A45C

0xDB06C2B2
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
0xE658C397
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
0x48A921BB

0xDB06C2B2
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
0x7D2B22C3
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
0x22F1ABC9
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
0x425DC081
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
0xC85B2DC2
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
0x891798A7
from the stranger.
0x47739576

0xDB06C2B2
"You are very hungry," he said.
0x85770A6D

0xDB06C2B2
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
0xB6C19BC2
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
0x82A13015

0xDB06C2B2
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
0xCC40441D
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
0x1DAC78A4
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
0xB6F7207A
immoderately."
0xDF114489

0xDB06C2B2
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
0x0C7AD973
contrived, unpolished answer.
0xE3DA0E3D

0xDB06C2B2
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
0x48B7E303
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
0x437CB6E3

0xDB06C2B2
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
0x76CCA93D
absolutely without home and friends."
0xA79AC2CF

0xDB06C2B2
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
0x720380FF
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
0x8712E52A
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
0xC06BC925
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
0x14383371
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
0xD5645978
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
0xC2FD9C49
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
0x2ED9E2BD
to encourage.
0xBAE0C651

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
0x03562C06
every connection?"
0x1739166E

0xDB06C2B2
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
0x1491DAC2
to admittance under any roof in England."
0x3881C1B2

0xDB06C2B2
"A most singular position at your age!"
0xCAB1EA7C

0xDB06C2B2
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
0x12BE0073
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
0x15006D96
explained the quest.
0x6CDC7831

0xDB06C2B2
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
0x51414D62

0xDB06C2B2
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
0x1C89F22B
St. John," said she.
0x9D51D3D5

0xDB06C2B2
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
0x3C52E84C

0xDB06C2B2
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
0x27A5523E
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
0xC8BB2CD5
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
0x692365C1
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
0x9686CDF2
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
0x75FF884D
out tears as well as colour.
0x59C37348

0xDB06C2B2
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
0x45A54235

0xDB06C2B2
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
0x425018E3
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
0x0DDB7B33
piercing look.
0xEC20A705

0xDB06C2B2
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
0x5DD62476
secret," I replied concisely.
0x73321F46

0xDB06C2B2
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
0x3AF5C2C3
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
0x63928572

0xDB06C2B2
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
0xDEF89EDD
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
0x03FC8B86

0xDB06C2B2
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
0x70A60820
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
0xF3B6D5B0
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
0xCC90DEFB

0xDB06C2B2
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
0x6FB03CE2
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
0x7F8ACDD0
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
0xC801F8C4

0xDB06C2B2
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
0x434B2214
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
0xB99A5221
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
0xFE76499D

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
0x913FCA1F
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
0x80954CED
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
0xDB017898
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
0xB3127375
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
0x5DFA8554
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
0xF2F11962
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
0x5C67EE82
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
0xE02F63B6

0xDB06C2B2
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
0xDBD1FB29
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
0x8ABF3398
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
0x2B7ACD28
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
0xF12BE5AE
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
0x1B48E14D
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
0x43E9D1F6

0xDB06C2B2
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
0xAEB011D7

0xDB06C2B2
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
0x608F38CC
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
0x6D792C8E
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
0x9678DA78
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
0xAC9236B3
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
0xDEFC373E
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
0xD9BA0B97
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
0x7E57886D
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
0x840B0BEC
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
0x5CD44A47
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
0x5CE9959E
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
0xA5D4BAC7
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
0xB42B7EA1
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
0x2E5854B0
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
0x871A0632
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
0x05C26BCE
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
0xD6241625
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
0xDD5D6C07
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
0xFC2BAA41
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
0x0C2C721C
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
0x59DAC98E

0xDB06C2B2
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
0xDFFBA7E9
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
0x3E755453
down now, Miss Elliott."
0xE79ED6EF

0xDB06C2B2
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
0x9E765153
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
0x98624949
once.
0x2715FAD5

0xDB06C2B2
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
0x23C6DEA2

0xDB06C2B2
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
0x09CD8D6D
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
0x0C5C17CA
sounds strange to me."
0x9BF2F411

0xDB06C2B2
"Your real name you will not give?"
0xA61BC546

0xDB06C2B2
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
0xAD395E19
lead to it, I avoid."
0x739D498D

0xDB06C2B2
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her
0x2C795354
be at peace a while."
0x4911A495

0xDB06C2B2
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
0x77BEEE60
and with as much acumen as ever.
0x75195A36

0xDB06C2B2
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
0x6FCAACBF
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
0x2082E9E2
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
0x3FB18ED1
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of
0xE0108C10
us?"
0x8974D667

0xDB06C2B2
"I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work:
0x97DA5BF5
that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest
0xE94FB2AB
cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of
0x8C77428A
the horrors of homeless destitution."
0xAF108699

0xDB06C2B2
"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
0x5FD49D25
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
0x42B82E78
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
0xA2B6090E

0xDB06C2B2
"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,
0xD244DB70
"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen
0x1A7DA91D
bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel
0x9C52F44A
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
0xBCDFA012
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the
0x21D07DF6
incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
0x9ED77A6B
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
0xB7133005
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."
0x8C3F7D9A

0xDB06C2B2
"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
0x74E93740
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
0x3F2FA5C2
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."
0x8E22D6A3

0xDB06C2B2
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
0xE0A1844F
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
0xE7697D03

0xDB06C2B2
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
0xE40AD7F2
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
0xA66F959F

0xDB06C2B2
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
0xA07F9579
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
0x10FC6AD7
present strength would permit.

CHAPTER XXX
0x9F7FE578

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
0x60AFB312
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
0x24B7D83A
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
0xE572BD2B
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
0x0967F466
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
0x156DEFA1
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
0xE99C98F1
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
0xC5A38B63

0xDB06C2B2
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
0x9A195AAD
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
0x6092E2A6
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
0x1707FDCC
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
0x7C74B9A4
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
0x05884523
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
0xB99A0219
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
0x06CE3FA1
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
0x7F67A7D9
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
0xEC20A9E0
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
0x4D2DFB0B
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
0xE92E4F7E
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
0x53F550A2
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
0xF429B3BE
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
0x5FC1B4A9
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
0x8BA0FEED
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
0xFC9718C5
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
0xADDEEC78
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
0xBC0A21C9
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
0xB73D4669
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
0x3102B717
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
0x5FEBC595
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
0xB3D97332
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
0xD492552C
that entranced theirs.
0x9B4A58E9

0xDB06C2B2
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
0x37EB66B9
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
0xE3C7D077
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
0x258D1CD1
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
0xC49D64E8
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
0x71F369B5
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
0xFCA2F0E7

0xDB06C2B2
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
0xC112A41C
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
0x9DE97221
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
0xAAEC93DA
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
0xFCF10C42
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
0x09C520E3
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
0x66E4DF8A
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
0x9918A32A
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
0x2A97D18B
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
0xB070D382
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
0xEEC559AA
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
0x6849A87A
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
0x7E5B72B7
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
0x7C921BE4
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
0xB876EB36
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
0x05B12B98
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
0x02B72B2B
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
0xF385FFC6

0xDB06C2B2
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
0x04A849F2
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
0x0CC1121E
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
0x644498CB
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
0x9E2C2C36
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
0x8FAF520B

0xDB06C2B2
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
0xDF4CEFFF
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
0xEC578651
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
0x6873F9D2
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
0xA7C8AFBE
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
0x2C061FA4
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
0xFEC0A413
cheerful--
0xA9DF2CC7

0xDB06C2B2
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
0xE66B6B87
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
0x107F8810
propose to myself?"
0x90CE1909

0xDB06C2B2
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
0x331AAF36
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
0xD2001DF6

0xDB06C2B2
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
0x4D711B7B
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
0x66339E48
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
0xBFAC70A4
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
0xBDF21319
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
0x71C1AC7A
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
0xE2FBA3CA
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
0x3EDB1728
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
0xA117452B
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
0xDC615A53
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
0x42FEB328

0xDB06C2B2
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
0xFC7AB92F
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
0xF5E292B8
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
0x11A8DF82
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
0x3054E519
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
0xBBF05C4C
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
0xEED5156D
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
0x095F5250
delights they could yield.
0x4ADAA321

0xDB06C2B2
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
0xE2920B19
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
0xBC65B995
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
0x810BCC2F
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
0x2E84E88B
produced on me.
0xF5ACDC88

0xDB06C2B2
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
0x9F7E3EE2
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
0x669896B1
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
0x75B47536
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
0xBCDC3662
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
0xF0AEC35A
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
0xC275F428
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
0x8C2A2930
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
0x8E7AE0A0
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
0xE484BFB5
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
0x996E35BF
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
0x961631C3
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
0x9B01684B
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
0x4E6C8195
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
0x3C925A49
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
0x51CBE3D9
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
0xA1BDA8AB
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
0x260F5871
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
0xF1306A98
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
0x72D708B8
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
0x7887DFF6

0xDB06C2B2
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
0xF4F21C59
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
0x02A8DE5B
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
0xC7460511
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
0x664F0B30
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
0xCC16CFC9
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
0xF24D1A7C
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
0x88FB70B8
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
0xE2B55C9C
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
0x0114A020
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
0x66BEFA0B
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
0x58B3913C
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
0x27A40A19
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
0x4AE63718
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
0xEB7FBAEC
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
0xA35FD5B2
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
0xCB625127

0xDB06C2B2
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
0x5DC59A26

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
0x1FCEA26C
myself to undertake?"
0xA641A4C7

0xDB06C2B2
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
0x74080012
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
0xCD41CAFD
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
0xB44AE1A7
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
0x5933712A
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
0x4375577E

0xDB06C2B2
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
0x03514642

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
0xA53FA4E2
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
0x7C853F16

0xDB06C2B2
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
0x111E1BBC
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
0x48CE90D2
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
0x74F911F0
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
0x95949298
interest to me.
0x66D0E674

0xDB06C2B2
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
0x34A3860C
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
0x58E9E094

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
0x9FAA0AC9
you to accept."
0xBC828781

0xDB06C2B2
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
0x654904C3
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
0x438F176B
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
0x9F362689
could have done, and with less trouble.
0x4DDA67CD

0xDB06C2B2
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
0xB42E26AB
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
0x45BC42EB
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
0x47BCB645
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
0x0BAD111A
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
0x92CA6068
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
0x1FBBBBBC
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
0x040F047A
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
0xEEC12C25
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
0xC519F1E1
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
0x3EB3BD9A
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
0x388A359D
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
0x38846356
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
0x6F1A691E
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
0x80C29868
'Rise, follow Me!'"
0xD5E49ADA

0xDB06C2B2
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
0xAD593DB8
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
0xBAECBD02
glance.  He resumed--
0x2BA6A32F

0xDB06C2B2
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
0x7B0050FD
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
0xBB502C8D
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
0xEDFB6D5D
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
0x8F0D08AD
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
0x83F065A0
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
0x45D60EE5
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
0xB2470B8D
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
0x007CF734
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
0x3811E4FF
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
0xB086FB4F

0xDB06C2B2
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
0x667CD08C

0xDB06C2B2
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
0x3DCB33E3
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
0xBCB54565
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
0x87AAEAD0
succeeding observations.
0x7DEF4CCA

0xDB06C2B2
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
0x117B8724
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
0xE8A55A12
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
0xF8EB06A4
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
0x9963AB8B
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
0xA59D4258

0xDB06C2B2
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
0xFF979B98

0xDB06C2B2
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
0xA6582061
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
0x621A915C
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
0x0E991427
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
0x2260F229
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
0xCAF8D858
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
0x2FD157D2
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
0xF6B5D12B
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
0x0107D04A
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
0xBCFFAA97
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
0x36958471
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
0xBF7BC384
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
0xD960B81E
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
0x84145EAF
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
0xF3650F53
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
0xA64B3187
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
0x194A08B0
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
0x80AF817E

0xDB06C2B2
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
0x4BECB69A
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
0x8C45F9A7
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
0x58A9FA91
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
0x121CC7A7
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
0xACA3E071
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
0x2B10AD07
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
0x7EFF304D
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
0xD9CEE481
decision.
0xDE1768D8

0xDB06C2B2
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
0xA11383F0
heart."
0x935C84FC

0xDB06C2B2
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
0x6C779C6E
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
0x1DDCEF43
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
0x6C76DE78
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
0x1021CEEB
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
0x0DC43D38

0xDB06C2B2
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
0x6C6C7F59

0xDB06C2B2
"You know what you undertake, then?"
0x314E9CD4

0xDB06C2B2
"I do."
0x4FD4783E

0xDB06C2B2
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
0x0E660A42
deeply gratified.
0x0AC94068

0xDB06C2B2
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
0xFEA6A11D

0xDB06C2B2
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
0x23E47038
week."
0x40784D0F

0xDB06C2B2
"Very well: so be it."
0x6264C5D2

0xDB06C2B2
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
0x0B9C4580
me.  He shook his head.
0xC2E41A74

0xDB06C2B2
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
0x2CD27BF2

0xDB06C2B2
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
0xFE48DA3F

0xDB06C2B2
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
0xD39E46D1

0xDB06C2B2
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
0x1AE82058
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
0xCD6AB52F

0xDB06C2B2
"I am not ambitious."
0xE9F34002

0xDB06C2B2
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
0xFF31ADE8
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
0xE35376D9
it out?"
0x81039F21

0xDB06C2B2
"I was speaking of myself."
0x0E1593E7

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
0xF08C2308

0xDB06C2B2
"What?"
0xF668A3E1

0xDB06C2B2
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
0x9A6ADD1C
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
0xF6FD4F28
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
0x9B7CFF9D
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
0x8CDA1301
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
0x12B15E06
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
0x7DAB3D96
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
0x75A7B5DC
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
0x23DC6C7B
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
0x4D7DC0F4
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
0x062387CB
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
0xF8534FCE
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
0x7A701EEE
some means."
0x213B7F0B

0xDB06C2B2
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
0x574D26AE
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
0x792CA412

0xDB06C2B2
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
0xE84F1115
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
0xAD877F92
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
0x5E683B9C
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
0xC23A2725
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
0x39377FDA
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
0x0A7BB4CA
parting for life.
0x299F23CF

0xDB06C2B2
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
0x1DDA58BA
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
0x06CDA1D8
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
0xB0524AE9
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
0xE7F78E3B
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
0x94791770
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
0x037F7654
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
0x547D2F82
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
0x6D70850A

0xDB06C2B2
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
0xB8F3E8A3
she murmured.
0x66DDE2C2

0xDB06C2B2
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
0xBD773B4C
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
0x537D34B4
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
0xBA1ECE22
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
0x39314D6B
letter.  He entered.
0xB45E4FD3

0xDB06C2B2
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
0x80AB43DE

0xDB06C2B2
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
0x88AC5384
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
0x94529AA4

0xDB06C2B2
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
0x186FA453

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
0x42D93EC2
demanded, in a low voice.
0x1DE1687E

0xDB06C2B2
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
0x35D9B454
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
0xED7CEB8B

0xDB06C2B2
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
0xF1503A3A
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
0xBF946004
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
0x9106DC3F
enough.
0x553A4B6A

0xDB06C2B2
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
0x3ADAF4D3

0xDB06C2B2
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
0x4DF9101F
Mary.
0x2F300799

0xDB06C2B2
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
0x0FAD3962
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
0xE0F061BC
what _is_."
0x2DD4B257

0xDB06C2B2
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
0x026B9992

0xDB06C2B2
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
0x1BDB52C1

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
0x354DB076
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
0x8603B51B
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
0xC4964688
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
0x3120B265
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
0x726AA520
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
0x3177377D
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
0xE2CCDB86
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
0x24254688
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
0xE2863D4E
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
0x11B8AFE1
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
0x6AA64456
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
0x1A07F78B
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
0x5AC8654D
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
0xF73B4082
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
0x9A737460
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
0x92AD1FA8
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
0xD58A95FC
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
0xAA1DA313
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
0x7B4B846F

0xDB06C2B2
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
0x7CD15444
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
0x9B0879E1
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
0xA08BE527
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
0x8C6D1A65
and so the old grange was abandoned.

CHAPTER XXXI
0xFEF3B4B8

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
0x2C097C38
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
0x951DA969
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
0xC9F9AD29
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
0xAA35B138
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
0x0B9C2311
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
0x6352B94A
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
0x18E28ACD
things as are necessary.
0xC7543888

0xDB06C2B2
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
0x5ADA8558
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
0x9EC31913
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
0x293E34CF
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
0xB654658D
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
0x3901F108
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
0xE9913718
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
0xD4CBD636
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
0x002605A7
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
0x21FDD3E3
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
0x2D295654
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
0xE4CAEA97
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
0x94B49748
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
0x81E40F66
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
0xC8765D07
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
0x5DCA2C6F
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
0xB4DE66FE
on from day to day.
0x51084133

0xDB06C2B2
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
0xC78625CF
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
0x84CDC76D
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
0xBF54F100
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
0x148251AD
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
0x63CAB53A
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
0x4E668EF6
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
0x0613A527
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
0x6824B112
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
0x4DC6C4A2
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
0x36A1458A
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
0x9C5996C4
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
0x008C8AE3
gratification for disgust.
0x90B4411D

0xDB06C2B2
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
0xD2C691F4
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
0xE5B2CEEA
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
0x984FCE53
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
0x8F53C6E8
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
0xFC90BE76
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
0xE3A06B2C
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
0x8E9238D6
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
0xFC69D8F1
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
0xA820F010
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
0xFD040DDF
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
0x61975B55
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
0xB67B69EC
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
0xB0AD5BA5
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
0xD7738D26
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
0xCAFC04ED
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
0x90A27236

0xDB06C2B2
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
0x2388BC01
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
0xDF64BBA5
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
0x9308A0F2

0xDB06C2B2
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
0x149654B2
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
0xEE6E6658
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
0xF38FEF99
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
0x9979C4FF

0xDB06C2B2
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
0xDAB78D4A

0xDB06C2B2
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
0x3F18888B
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
0xAAD1E5ED
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
0x79B5B091
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
0x520160D5
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
0x6D0A33FE
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
0xFCBFC0E7
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
0x01B6F840
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
0x7F0DD3E8
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
0x1D29222D
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
0x983555B6
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
0xE0132271
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
0x84536DDD
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
0x2750A42E
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
0x7D581467
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
0x83E3624D
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
0x16426963

0xDB06C2B2
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
0xD33FBC50
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
0xE8254465

0xDB06C2B2
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
0x0CB1BBE2
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
0x25195E85
doubtless very visible upon it.
0x720111CF

0xDB06C2B2
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
0x66F96C24
asked.
0x47698892

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
0xB7290269
scholars very well."
0x4F5182FD

0xDB06C2B2
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
0x0D249674
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
0x08685EA8
I interrupted--
0x6219A407

0xDB06C2B2
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
0x3DA7A13E
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
0x6873BC42
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
0x2918FA1E
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
0x5B55E38E
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
0xC7B321E4
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
0x3CC5D752
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
0x9DF522C8

0xDB06C2B2
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
0xF0EE92C1
is dark and empty."
0x00432B0B

0xDB06C2B2
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
0x539FA67C
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
0xC3CAC724

0xDB06C2B2
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
0x2AC3BBBB
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
0x38523312
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
0x317EA263
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
0xC9024A49
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
0x769F23EC
steadily, for some months at least."
0x5C7492CB

0xDB06C2B2
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
0x325BAB77

0xDB06C2B2
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
0xDABA2D34
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
0x854218AF
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
0x26B4EA97
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
0x5B40D374
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
0x7D1A392B
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
0x9CD7C53E
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
0xC9D4C664
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
0x2D2A2EB3
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
0xECBF9DBA
rougher than it.
0x7287B620

0xDB06C2B2
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
0x9E9B925F
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
0xF5089CDE
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
0x1F63AE2F
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
0x037FAA52
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
0xE811B582
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
0x82303CEF
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
0x8D6E3AB3
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
0x96DAF4A5
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
0x54FE552A
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
0x27C790BF
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
0xB18C4C39
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
0xC3322B4A
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
0x76B1B0B6
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
0xFCBDECD9
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
0x81F80C3F

0xDB06C2B2
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
0xFE79D6F5
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
0x2616988D
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
0x1B40393A
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
0x44FB9789
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
0x306BEAF8
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
0x3C9DDE13
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
0x7BD0B43E
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
0x8CD537CD
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
0x96276A4E

0xDB06C2B2
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
0xC0EEFB24
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
0x52E3BF56
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
0x7642B374
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
0x5C277191
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
0xE57D6363
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
0x3BEEA621
exclaimed--
0xE720ACC4

0xDB06C2B2
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
0x35AD3D67
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
0x91A647B2
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
0x2011A8A4
your back towards me now."
0x9A3AEBDC

0xDB06C2B2
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
0x830A4D2A
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
0x38A849DE
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
0x04E8C60F
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
0xAC54A170
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
0x9C1199F0
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
0xF49650E4
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
0x018544FF
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
0x128F2934
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
0xDE396BC9
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
0x00919034
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
0xA593C018
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
0xA1CC2EA8
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
0x41BAF37E
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
0xE270697D
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
0xE08F2DFC
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
0x1E95A8E1
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
0xAC8E5533
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
0xA7A40982
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
0x6457E4A3
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
0x908F19BE
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
0x51139B6E
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
0xC7F6E671
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
0xC039AA3E
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
0xBAA393E2
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
0x790F707C
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
0x0485165F
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
0xA0AC5869

0xDB06C2B2
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
0xBFF3F3CE
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
0xBE9828B4
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
0xA297510C
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
0x854FA158
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
0x1D5688F3

0xDB06C2B2
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
0x1BE0818D
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
0xA4989770

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
0xFDBCC60B
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
0x89DE7130
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
0x457B99FE
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
0xD74EF777
pointing to me.
0xE3CF6B6F

0xDB06C2B2
"It is," said St. John.
0xDFE1366D

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
0x8C2A3C3B
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
0x056BEACA

0xDB06C2B2
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
0x0415657D

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
0xC223C8E8

0xDB06C2B2
"Quite."
0xF80D7D11

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you like your house?"
0x2B9FB4EF

0xDB06C2B2
"Very much."
0xFF92834A

0xDB06C2B2
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
0xCA076A16

0xDB06C2B2
"Very nicely, indeed."
0x05644BC0

0xDB06C2B2
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
0xB9FBFD98

0xDB06C2B2
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
0x7C30E1A8
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
0xE1AFBB48
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
0x17D79CF8
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
0x66D2CD71

0xDB06C2B2
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
0xF87EC46D
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
0x157A55C9
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
0x3E27BEBA
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
0xC0AAD3C7
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
0xE3FE80BF
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
0x4B3CB245
merchants to shame."
0xF2CD6546

0xDB06C2B2
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
0x58AD3F47
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
0x388F8038
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
0xA33C18F5
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
0x72AD8C65
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
0x19A6822D
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
0xDE0A4F66
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
0x3B97F279

0xDB06C2B2
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
0xA4DC17A2
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
0xCCCE4D22
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
0x7A8A8411

0xDB06C2B2
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
0x5B5DBDD8
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
0x7FCFB056
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
0xBDCCD294
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
0x77FECF5B
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
0xD4C1C150
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
0xEA0EF91D
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
0x92984359
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
0x02BACF19
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
0xC01686C7

0xDB06C2B2
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
0x7CFFE3D5
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
0xEF4CA030
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
0x20C0D7C6

0xDB06C2B2
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
0xD78AA4A7
John.
0x601EEF39

0xDB06C2B2
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
0x0F0EDCDB
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
0x36555AD6
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
0xF89A4221
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
0xE0D2C466
her own.
0x3B875CCA

0xDB06C2B2
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
0xB0F27367
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
0xAA1B09D8
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
0x1FE80931
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
0x58D15DD4
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
0x7E294980
papa."
0x2D1A6CC9

0xDB06C2B2
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
0x3ED5CA12

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
0x8CDFF868
it cost him thus to refuse.
0x606BDDEF

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
0xD20CC540
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
0xAC8D95C2

0xDB06C2B2
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
0x187192E5
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
0x62D8A4EE
returned.
0xA8997FD3

0xDB06C2B2
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
0x4DB030AA
blanched as her gown.
0x412F2BC2

0xDB06C2B2
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
0x42F0FCFA
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
0xCEE117BB
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
0x2AC6DDFA
at all.
0x43ECA7A0

0xDB06C2B2
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
0x2B17F821
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
0x6F90BE80
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.

CHAPTER XXXII
0x7C588D8B

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
0xB60A55C1
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
0x62DF0BD5
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
0x742C3194
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
0xB8E34ED5
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
0x3C43ACA1
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
0x7719AE98
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
0x084F3C89
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
0x8A0B9618
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
0xF0AA0AF1
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
0x46B237DA
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
0x13F2452E
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
0x669C17CE
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
0x6BEB6702
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
0x690F8DFF
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
0xC38FD0D5
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
0x37A4E100
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
0xEE6D185D
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
0x2DD0F5E7
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
0xA2F7D7AA
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
0x72DF6D17
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
0x3AF6677D
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
0x47B30C3C
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
0x981B0A48
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
0xDF7FBD1B
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
0xBBE263EF
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
0xDF18C7E0
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
0x81D9DC29
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
0xD664C69C
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
0xABB8FAB1
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
0x7B151DC1

0xDB06C2B2
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
0x3FA1F0D5
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
0x49466105
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
0x8F617AAB
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
0xCE1980D1
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
0x33D8EE64
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
0x88321EC3
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
0xB6C4869A
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
0x0645BE85
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
0x8553A2FD
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
0x0B66F48B
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
0x3C25A744
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
0xF23A5B02
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
0x88173575
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
0x8F4B3838
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
0xD1B21FFD
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
0x0A85A31E
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
0x928D4DD1
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
0x1AFFA905
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
0x7B01F093
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
0xEB46F236
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
0x477D1821
duties of the day.
0x2A2B72A9

0xDB06C2B2
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
0x1F49AC30
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
0x8A273843
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
0x6BB2E11C
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
0xA5D08EC0
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
0x83A69F94
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
0xB8C1C7C7
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
0x72D03967
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
0x7695DD74
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
0x7AA64D71
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
0xEFA7BF3F
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
0x07C138D7
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
0x35631C4E
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
0x2D0EF844
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
0x05AF16F8
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
0xC5CD52E2
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
0x5F547BD7

0xDB06C2B2
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
0x0F7FC768
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
0x9C78807B
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
0x1039C55B
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
0x75A98723
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
0x557CE7EF
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
0xFC7DAE5C
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
0x1E02DCA0
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
0xE111A0AF
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
0xB48C8FF7

0xDB06C2B2
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
0xF54A3DEB
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
0x68A6A618
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
0x0CEB9604
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
0x5D2BC873
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
0xFCB45BA3
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
0xDF92D014
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
0x05AD0C61
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
0x3E9D824D
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
0x75E89469
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
0x0B453021
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
0xDC37FDB0
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
0x8330DDAF

0xDB06C2B2
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
0xD444B4A1
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
0xA4F85D0A
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
0xD5625CE1
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
0x0E0D91CE
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
0x5A5AB9BC
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
0x0DB34675
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
0x4F22C2C4
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
0x6DEF0B4A
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
0x9F137E61
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
0xD50AAE33
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
0xA8F4834D
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
0x518BEA78
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
0xE4065DE0
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
0xBFBDE14A
acquaintance.
0x6CD496C8

0xDB06C2B2
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
0x0498BD86
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
0x964F22FB
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
0x5CE1C7DB
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
0x94F3636B
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
0xC2A84BB5
if known, would make a delightful romance.
0x5F8C493C

0xDB06C2B2
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
0x6913D8C8
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
0x5756FA63
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
0xB13B2205
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
0xE0D50478
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
0x97637C3B
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
0x425F31EC
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
0x936EAF59
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
0xFF762458

0xDB06C2B2
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
0x31393851
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
0xFA4E7D10
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
0x94F932F9

0xDB06C2B2
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
0x289BD8FB
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
0x637744FF
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
0xAABB4CDF
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
0xB44DBEBF
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
0x92D9ECE7
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
0xF87A975F
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
0x7216A2D6
day.
0x024CF5DD

0xDB06C2B2
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
0x0ED3F1D3
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
0x5D85DBB6
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
0xFF1CD86D
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
0xAB74AD17
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
0x2FC7AD40
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
0xA14CDBEA
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
0xF117E71D
Hall.
0x9D88BC3F

0xDB06C2B2
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
0x03D3BB68
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
0x31196B14
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
0x66CA4CE1
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
0xBF5F9FE0
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
0x1EB5A6B9
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
0xFDA441D4
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
0xC0C6EC8F

0xDB06C2B2
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
0xF3E1594E
high family, papa."
0x6E7E7BC4

0xDB06C2B2
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
0x2A0BC00B
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
0xD6A02741
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
0xB33E2946
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
0xC5528B38
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
0x716E043F
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
0xADA8144B
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
0x108C8A9F
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
0x48BFF463
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
0xC7F6380D
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
0xD38AB157
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
0x92E0740C
compensation for the want of fortune.
0xCCE4B7E3

0xDB06C2B2
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
0xD00B3001
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
0xF35FAA93
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
0xA6133DBF
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
0xEA99298A
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
0x7892327F

0xDB06C2B2
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
0x12B7EA2B
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
0x95FD43FD
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
0xD992F0D0
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
0xA2B53DE1
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
0xB3407072
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
0x9EEB67BE
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
0xD769074D
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
0xA0241F92
Rivers.
0x970FC64E

0xDB06C2B2
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
0xD4B45EAF
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
0x2ACE82F0
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
0xE2EA3118
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
0xC9BD2D9A
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
0x2717C6FD
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
0xCC0BC620
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
0x4B729793
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
0x4555CBF8
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
0x6BA164D1
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
0x2E0E40C4
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
0xECCDDD26
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
0xC779CCBC
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
0xFC15B014
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
0x0BAA0F66
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
0x5230800E
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
0xD6496621

0xDB06C2B2
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
0xE6CD5674
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
0xBA5F4FD0
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
0x71D971C9
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
0x77C9C1F6
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
0x29B51917
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
0xD1E67D93
him some good, if I could.
0xC95AFEDD

0xDB06C2B2
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
0x148E6A55
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
0x17A1ECA5
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
0xD72ABC7A
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
0xBF11CA93
him talk."
0x0892F75E

0xDB06C2B2
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
0xAAF85274
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
0xBE5E12C9
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
0x2C8D0D0B
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
0x75ADBACB
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
0xA0004ED0
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
0x980170F2

0xDB06C2B2
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
0xE2CD6EF2

0xDB06C2B2
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
0x4A46DF44

0xDB06C2B2
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
0x58EB2357

0xDB06C2B2
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
0x774F5242
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
0xB93EF76D
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
0xED26A667
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
0x2D762933
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
0xF804CB39
rose and placed it in his hand.
0xDF0F221D

0xDB06C2B2
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
0x5C36D198
graceful and correct drawing."
0x941D0429

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
0xE3D63A95
like?"
0x857137F9

0xDB06C2B2
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
0xE03C931A

0xDB06C2B2
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
0x1C149838
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
0xB3EAE581
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
0x9C287D4A
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
0xB6F6413D
deem worthless."
0xE0A994F8

0xDB06C2B2
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
0xC5540B68
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
0x8954D753
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
0x0FDC55E3
smiles!"
0x25C2CB36

0xDB06C2B2
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
0x8498C647
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
0xC82D10BB
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
0x7307C60F
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
0x38BFCAAE

0xDB06C2B2
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
0x6F4ED0F6
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
0x3476CADC

0xDB06C2B2
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
0x805616CB
or wise is another question."
0x8C08CC70

0xDB06C2B2
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
0x69AB0561
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
0x4E52DA9E
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
0x40315BA4
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
0x8CFF5F2B
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
0xD89F6FAA
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
0x448695F1
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
0x59063099

0xDB06C2B2
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
0xACC91CC1
take to yourself the original at once."
0xFAB38565

0xDB06C2B2
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
0xC269C0C3
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
0x1226802E
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
0xD087B412
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
0x1B77F9BE
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
0x5F4CC6CD
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
0x960789AE
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
0xD763BBC4
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
0x97CCC761
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
0x68C74A2A
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
0x86C668E9

0xDB06C2B2
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
0xA572954E
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
0x9C22264C
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
0xD84E7954
ought to marry her."
0x360720B4

0xDB06C2B2
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
0xBF2B3C9E

0xDB06C2B2
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
0xB41D1469
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
0x99DC6731
often."
0x9FB1A2D7

0xDB06C2B2
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
0x34A739E0
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
0xC2717B33
the table to measure the time.
0x913624F2

0xDB06C2B2
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
0x6A1F4739
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
0x358669FA
fetter your heart?"
0xCFD38E9C

0xDB06C2B2
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
0x51ECF76F
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
0x7178DDB5
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
0xF935BD03
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
0x3B6F14F7
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
0x0BCC0E1F
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
0x4549468E
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
0x93B05767
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
0x1384E33A
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
0x4A60654E
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
0x10F8BD95
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
0x16546CAA
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
0x137A6BB5
time I marked pass in peace."
0xB1EC35E4

0xDB06C2B2
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
0xA277E835
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
0xFF59E03E
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
0xA9F00528

0xDB06C2B2
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
0xD3651A70
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
0x87156133
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
0x5745E644
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
0x3D686175
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
0xCD4BDA5F

0xDB06C2B2
I gazed at him in wonder.
0x9C9FCF04

0xDB06C2B2
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
0xDFEDB08C
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
0x453396D4
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
0x1CF02619
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
0x3544DEA7
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
0x2AC2EED1
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
0xC9E9CCD8
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
0x228FE1D1

0xDB06C2B2
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
0xC1DCB03A

0xDB06C2B2
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
0x02E7C1C4
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
0x037A56F2
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
0xF904219D
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
0x69359D54
a missionary's wife?  No!"
0xA715AD55

0xDB06C2B2
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
0xC5C8F1F9

0xDB06C2B2
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
0x72C95830
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
0x8C2BC62A
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
0x8ECEDBCE
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
0x597959DF
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
0xA93E7425
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
0x449E59BC
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
0xD9229C0E
live for."
0x8251A68C

0xDB06C2B2
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
0x0ABB7F96
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
0x80A6018A

0xDB06C2B2
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
0xEF4F014D
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
0x9A0D1454
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
0x88BAEA9E
should do."
0x86237EC1

0xDB06C2B2
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
0x520B432F
wasting away."
0x7B0C9572

0xDB06C2B2
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
0xD2283B6E
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
0xB066CDB3
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
0x5AA19BEC
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
0xDA02F54D
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
0xC5D3071A

0xDB06C2B2
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
0x00A9928E
schoolroom."
0x796C6364

0xDB06C2B2
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
0xCFEABF26
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
0x515F843D
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
0x6152322C
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
0x0BC7EE57
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
0x2D6EA62A
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
0xA29EAFEF

0xDB06C2B2
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
0xE8AD7F12
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
0xEAA09254
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
0x718C4090
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
0x14C58148
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
0xD2DC090F
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
0xAB4226C0
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
0x74625F04
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
0x0BD0AD64
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
0x8A914BDA

0xDB06C2B2
I smiled incredulously.
0xC047B2F1

0xDB06C2B2
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
0xC0B61EF0
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
0xF7CE0B55
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
0x3A385F63
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
0x8CB38104
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
0x0771125A
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
0xD53DCC12
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
0x2178E5B1
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
0x123BC405
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
0x69E34489
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
0x35BA852E
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
0xE57BB418
still suffer."
0xAFF925BB

0xDB06C2B2
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
0x467F965D

0xDB06C2B2
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
0x9D03F3A7
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
0x30115899
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
0xF279F3E8
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
0xD5CED0BE
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
0x06BFE47A
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
0xFAF3E815
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
0xF9A0AAC3
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
0xE7152DC8
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
0x10B82D64
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
0xE0C9F976
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
0xA58B23E2
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
0x39175717
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
0x098799F9
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
0xFC5F0523

0xDB06C2B2
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
0xE36769B0
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
0x3C4EFF05

0xDB06C2B2
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
0x72D4F013
World, indeed!"
0xB9625BAD

0xDB06C2B2
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
0x45408262

0xDB06C2B2
"_Cui bono_?  No."
0x4B7EAA31

0xDB06C2B2
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
0xEAB7AD39
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
0x221CAA87
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
0xDA411741
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
0xA109A51C
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
0x62AE7F7B
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
0xD37EAB0C
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
0x48A8CE4E
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
0xB527B29E
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
0x97C88127

0xDB06C2B2
"What is the matter?" I asked.
0x69BFFCA9

0xDB06C2B2
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
0x232533F2
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
0xF84862EA
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
0xE79199EF

0xDB06C2B2
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
0x9D4534AB
globe, however!"
0x0B92DCF9

0xDB06C2B2
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
0x0A652445
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
0x13A4890C
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
0x22510898
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
0x7C6A8805
forgot it.
0x3210D8F8

CHAPTER XXXIII
0xCF7D7C33

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
0x2FC13DE5
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
0x5E3B4ACF
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
0xFC58A4C2
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
0x396A42A2
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
0x0B36C787
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
0xA40C19C1
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
0x85ECBB03

0xDB06C2B2
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
0xD4128AAF
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
0x4E514701
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
0x0DD46DC8
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
0xD9D3FE5F
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
0xED24E93B
      In yellow lustre shone"--
0x66887601

0xDB06C2B2
I soon forgot storm in music.
0xE9A7A193

0xDB06C2B2
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
0x75D72327
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
0xBC767AC7
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
0xC0206A62
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
0x1A0E8B5F
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
0xA717013D
vale that night.
0x6C45FDEC

0xDB06C2B2
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
0x6DBD2E78

0xDB06C2B2
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
0xB07DB7A9
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
0x0FB589A0
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
0x42B46BA4
boots.
0x12ED270C

0xDB06C2B2
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
0x39C9717B
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
0xA9CA986A
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
0x84656046
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
0x5980521D

0xDB06C2B2
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
0x59B9B90F

0xDB06C2B2
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
0xF30F86E5
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
0xD7CAB940
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
0xD194EBDB
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
0x06C5F9A7
impatient to hear the sequel."
0x2A07215F

0xDB06C2B2
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
0x1D80A6D2
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
0xCA27A90B
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
0xF09E223F
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
0x9922A2BA
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
0x505393A4
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
0xCCAC5860
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
0x2F8C5203
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
0xE2C0D984
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
0xB2982B3E
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
0x9C2312B1
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
0xCA92DAED

0xDB06C2B2
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
0x17363588
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
0xCA714E1F
health."
0xB437357D

0xDB06C2B2
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
0xF2AD1447
What do you see amiss in me?"
0x7CD2A200

0xDB06C2B2
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
0x7D1EEB60
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
0xC871C01F
silenced.
0x157D6204

0xDB06C2B2
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
0x5E9D1795
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
0x2497C265
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
0xD6D933EC
was behind him.
0xCDF6CCA5

0xDB06C2B2
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
0x3B10930C

0xDB06C2B2
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
0xF01F91B8
alone now, and return to my book."
0xB55642EA

0xDB06C2B2
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
0x3228354F
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
0x9E7A956B
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
0xED5BA577
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
0xA6769348
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
0x8FE4BBBB
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
0x82E833DC
I would.
0x49184254

0xDB06C2B2
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
0x3CA3F9E5

0xDB06C2B2
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
0x3B09383D

0xDB06C2B2
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
0xD1B5BC6E
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
0xF2653EB0

0xDB06C2B2
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
0x5CC6493D
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
0xC413111D
and my scholars.
0xA7922AA9

0xDB06C2B2
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
0xFB73A912
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
0xC66816DF
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
0x0B22754C

0xDB06C2B2
"Indeed!"
0x96271124

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
0xE123E0D5

0xDB06C2B2
"Does he?"
0x98E4C5FF

0xDB06C2B2
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
0x4D7849D5

0xDB06C2B2
"I know."
0xBF955CD1

0xDB06C2B2
"Was it your suggestion?"
0x9B4D4A2F

0xDB06C2B2
"No."
0xBB39FC9B

0xDB06C2B2
"Whose, then?"
0x95C9E61D

0xDB06C2B2
"His daughter's, I think."
0x89D80FDC

0xDB06C2B2
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
0x1CA6C11F

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
0x594E8A96
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
0x618B3933

0xDB06C2B2
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
0xD62DB4A7

0xDB06C2B2
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
0xFB681CC2

0xDB06C2B2
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
0x7FE4AC99
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
0x568C3843
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
0xA8AE48A5
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
0x339F1798
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
0x6792EEA9
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
0xC3C5B2B2
trite or novel, it is short.
0x301B384C

0xDB06C2B2
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
0xF5C31887
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
0xB98E3B48
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
0x059695FC
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
0x11E66576
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
0x065DC5A5
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
0x5FAC6C47
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
0xE753E989
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
0x9A6F7433
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
0x1358DC96
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
0xAAD50D09
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
0xB81FA7C6
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
0xD5325969
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
0x5694DF54
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
0x5A344DD0
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
0x73E49ACD
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
0xDD759C6B
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
0x5688F996
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
0x9FC154CA
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
0x7E900A75
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
0x54EE615A
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
0x9217A7DD
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
0x394FAB80
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
0x45EF27F0
Rochester."
0x3B069258

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
0x91E6B366

0xDB06C2B2
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
0x50D15AEF
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
0x7CC18387
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
0x1F21F451
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
0xFFC0AC98
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
0x5A00F16B
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
0x6957FA70
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
0xB1140EB9
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
0xFBDC3658
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
0xE0573905
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
0x628663AD
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
0x92E54A9A
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
0xD0BB312F
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
0xD84AAD98
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
0x4182CBEC
odd tale?"
0x4C922F1E

0xDB06C2B2
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
0x40F0E625
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
0xD548E41E
doing?  Is he well?"
0x920C7454

0xDB06C2B2
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions
0xA554D60B
him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
0x1A0A5AEC
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
0x07A02F61
which requires her appearance."
0xA961FE96

0xDB06C2B2
"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?  Did no one see Mr. Rochester?"
0x25604F66

0xDB06C2B2
"I suppose not."
0xCAD2820E

0xDB06C2B2
"But they wrote to him?"
0xB82138A7

0xDB06C2B2
"Of course."
0xD6B78A2F

0xDB06C2B2
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"
0x32C2D6D3

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.
0xD69A418A
Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
0x71A8FB18

0xDB06C2B2
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
0x6D191350
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
0x7340FEBD
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
0x01BC3F4C
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
0x5FA40EF7
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
0x1FB46EF8
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
0x55C0CFA5

0xDB06C2B2
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
0x04D5B60B

0xDB06C2B2
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
0x2744F938
warmth.
0xFDEDD033

0xDB06C2B2
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
0x76817BB9
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
0xE12F57BF
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
0x35D8FA13
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
0xEB0492AD
down, fairly committed to black and white."
0xCB5DA09B

0xDB06C2B2
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
0x10CCA566
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
0xD8CF4400
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
0x6DFB75A8
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
0x3E63116C
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
0x4D93B8FA
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
0x307F4F73
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
0xA58B6D75

0xDB06C2B2
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
0x7CD3CDAE
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
0xCC310372
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
0x8201D0AD
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
0xD97A13FF

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.
0xB0E2D1A6
Rochester than you do."
0x96B0E09B

0xDB06C2B2
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
0xA4FF4E19
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
0x168652B7
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
0x078093F9
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
0x1C98C7B5

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, what did he want?"
0x9DA80C52

0xDB06C2B2
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
0x710EA6A7
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
0x7BB46FC3
that--nothing more."
0x9B87D0A3

0xDB06C2B2
"I!--rich?"
0x9974F742

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
0x2178364B

0xDB06C2B2
Silence succeeded.
0x50E721C7

0xDB06C2B2
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
0x196B521E
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
0x8349A3EF
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
0x8927C7CD
will and the necessary documents."
0x2BC9A2AE

0xDB06C2B2
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
0xAA75DDDC
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
0x78051BD3
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
0x43CFD063
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
0x9C479196
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
0xA190E0CB
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
0xF4DC90A4
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
0x87981ECE
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
0xCEB9C5D5
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
0x7ABFB09D
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
0x8923B7E6

0xDB06C2B2
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
0x51F130A2
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
0x7BE42440
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
0xF10218FE
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
0x793E4252
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
0xD9965182
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
0x919DD74D
that--that thought swelled my heart.
0x5DB1ACBB

0xDB06C2B2
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
0x1F140D26
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
0x7CD37422
will ask how much you are worth?"
0x31D6F862

0xDB06C2B2
"How much am I worth?"
0xE5228F31

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
0xCB55514D
think they say--but what is that?"
0x98B1181E

0xDB06C2B2
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
0x61B51404

0xDB06C2B2
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
0x7D3BDEE6
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
0x52866294
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
0xD480DFA2

0xDB06C2B2
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
0x049189A4
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
0x286D2350

0xDB06C2B2
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
0x10B34532

0xDB06C2B2
"No mistake at all."
0x7C7D3C21

0xDB06C2B2
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
0x3FDB1D78

0xDB06C2B2
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
0xCDFC845D

0xDB06C2B2
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
0xDD8B56B8
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
0xBBE8F3CF
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
0x3D282193

0xDB06C2B2
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
0x32281FDC
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
0xC26DE9B0
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
0xD4AE0769
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
0x9C9783D9
Good-night."
0xD7AD83FE

0xDB06C2B2
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
0x9D7F81B8
minute!" I cried.
0xEC03BFA1

0xDB06C2B2
"Well?"
0xB08D08AE

0xDB06C2B2
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
0x8E52FDCD
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
0x5DD32C08
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
0xEFA14F9D

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
0xFDEBD051
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
0x99352923

0xDB06C2B2
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
0xF396F5B2
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
0x7D5BC06E
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
0x232A5877

0xDB06C2B2
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
0xC7EA081C
about it."
0x9D694D7D

0xDB06C2B2
"Another time."
0xF9B61E03

0xDB06C2B2
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
0x361F3EBD
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.
0x359D3E94

0xDB06C2B2
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
0xF1FD42AF

0xDB06C2B2
"I would rather not just now."
0xC09407AA

0xDB06C2B2
"You shall!--you must!"
0xF6957B6E

0xDB06C2B2
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
0xD3449BC1

0xDB06C2B2
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
0x73F51513
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
0xED173DD8

0xDB06C2B2
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
0xDCC9DA5F
persuade."
0xD07FA1AC

0xDB06C2B2
"And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off."
0xD5F194F1

0xDB06C2B2
{And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off: p369.jpg}
0x4FDBFED3

0xDB06C2B2
"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
0x3C76A7A0

0xDB06C2B2
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed
0x4FEF614E
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my
0xC321F354
floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be
0xCA79DA98
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
0xDE9B61E9
sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
0x5F156BAF

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
0xFDF5445A
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
0xBA5635AB
know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?"
0xE29F6C21

0xDB06C2B2
"Of course: that was all settled before."
0x817C7FA8

0xDB06C2B2
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was
0x8862919D
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
0xA3C680B0

0xDB06C2B2
"No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
0x74306160
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
0x3BB19544
never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--"
0x6721DDE7

0xDB06C2B2
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
0x5EB15D8F
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
0xA482B01D
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
0x1735BD13
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
0x7FA55B5E
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
0x55F79C4D
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
0xCE9F9975
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
0x1ED9FF91
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
0x67227F9B
explanation.
0x55C3A14F

0xDB06C2B2
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
0x5CE0670D
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
0x5E1B3E6C
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
0x7411F7DB
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
0xD7210651
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
0x58F8BFC4
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
0x90B76EC7
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
0x8E9BF907
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
0x3CB4003C
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
0x96FF0253
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
0xDEB3E84E
against the door.
0x348A69A7

0xDB06C2B2
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
0x64C9FE20
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
0xACDA8046
enough.  I resumed--
0x6205B23E

0xDB06C2B2
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
0xB89E5403

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"My aunt, consequently?"
0xB8701465

0xDB06C2B2
He bowed.
0x6B649C8F

0xDB06C2B2
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
0xA165E950
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
0x9F0BF1C5

0xDB06C2B2
"Undeniably."
0xBD572772

0xDB06C2B2
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
0xAAC79D71
the same source?"
0x54C0FADA

0xDB06C2B2
"We are cousins; yes."
0xEB3250E1

0xDB06C2B2
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
0xF6455A90
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
0x3347BA6A
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
0x2A2C220D
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
0xEDA972CD
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
0x765A08AA
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
0x9FEC9907
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
0xBE488A1F
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
0x2EB65034
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
0xBB0CDD6E
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
0x75EC0051
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
0x23199DB0
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
0x9229F34B
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
0xE0149737

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
0x708E8907

0xDB06C2B2
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
0x42F2A430
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
0x4E0B656D
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
0x999EEDD0

0xDB06C2B2
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
0x651D5D3C
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
0x3E2366ED
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
0x4BA9CFF2
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
0xD93C134C

0xDB06C2B2
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
0x7CB5AE98
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
0xB7032DCC
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
0x51A822D7
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
0x5110EC62
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
0x31BD7523
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
0x4AF00579
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
0xF92BD4FE
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
0xD9E9B1A8
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
0x5DAAEA24
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
0xF8C040A6
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
0x3415AFBF
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
0x4471C8D6
enjoyment.
0xC8CDDFA4

0xDB06C2B2
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
0x879069FD
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
0x10F8E371
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
0x7C31A16B
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
0x73AFFC6E
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
0x30D86A46

0xDB06C2B2
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
0xEC46B914
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
0x370A5E3A
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."
0xD60BD605

0xDB06C2B2
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must
0x91296FDC
really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
0xD813A68E

0xDB06C2B2
"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will
0x5B017428
it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down
0xF8BDAE45
like an ordinary mortal?"
0x8DFE3603

0xDB06C2B2
"You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in
0x6AD89EA9
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."
0xBAC3446B

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
0xE85F08DC
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."
0x742F7733

0xDB06C2B2
"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
0x869D05CF
comprehend better."
0x4967D509

0xDB06C2B2
"Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty
0x30B7D779
thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
0x74A6D83E
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I
0xB47A5427
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
0xA3B85009
fortune that has accrued to them."
0x614F9C8B

0xDB06C2B2
"To you, you mean."
0xDA555FDC

0xDB06C2B2
"I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
0xBD231685
other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
0x777C10B0
ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I
0xED8CCAEA
like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
0x216FB39E
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
0xBF358BBD
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
0x4EE8BC14
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,
0x281E571D
though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely
0x15E584CE
superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about
0xE00F34AB
it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once."
0xA9EA7DCD

0xDB06C2B2
"This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a
0x6824D865
matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."
0x5F53DCBB

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of
0x0FB64705
the case?"
0x44895B52

0xDB06C2B2
"I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.  Besides,
0x229F326A
the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts;
0xDC16E050
he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all,
0x3A5FE619
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience,
0xDA06F3FF
consider it absolutely your own."
0x76E48538

0xDB06C2B2
"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
0xE87AB6E5
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
0xDF1103EE
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
0xD98E015F
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
0x15482F1C
glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
0x60D002CA
myself lifelong friends."
0xF6FC3A10

0xDB06C2B2
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
0xE59A6A4E
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion
0x02311726
of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it
0xD701C023
would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to
0xEF4CF25D
you: you cannot--"
0x9C0CA6B4

0xDB06C2B2
"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
0x67CEED0B
fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or
0x9735F54F
sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me
0x11D4191E
and own me, are you?"
0x825061F5

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without
0x301FD382
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
0x12464CA3

0xDB06C2B2
"Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes;
0x6DBABC14
slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned
0x0DF6143B
and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation!
0xC62D06A2
Close union!  Intimate attachment!"
0x92320BFD

0xDB06C2B2
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may
0x618B8037
be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
0x4034DC31

0xDB06C2B2
"Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
0x7A469325

0xDB06C2B2
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
0xA0F943F4
excitement under which you labour."
0x90A5D384

0xDB06C2B2
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
0xC33636F0
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
0x234967F6
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
0x90717615
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
0x86664022
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-
0xD0409B25
feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I
0xB521A76E
was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."
0x9A13C8DE

0xDB06C2B2
"I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on
0xF9D31AE8
what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and
0xE7AC7E87
admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your
0xA0E83184
tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
0x8BE187AF
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
0x48E08406
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
0x75DF1B8A
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
0xAE79FE6B

0xDB06C2B2
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
0x4E18EC2E
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
0xB7FDC04C
scruple."
0xCF7DC597

0xDB06C2B2
"And the school, Miss Eyre?  It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
0x30AD9B85

0xDB06C2B2
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
0x6E805891

0xDB06C2B2
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
0x7B46195D

0xDB06C2B2
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
0x36159FEC
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
0x06AC6523
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
0xE263C32A
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
0x04D5AA5F
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
0xD4A78AD4
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
0x92C9FB67
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
0x0D560F0A
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
0x30DAA5FE
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
0x6FCD0871
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
0x4376537D
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.

CHAPTER XXXIV
0x5134EA1C

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
0x68954402
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
0xBD9FA240
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
0xC27CD4A8
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
0xE552DD3E
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
0x023CCEDB
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
0x2EA708D9
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
0xD468B355
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
0xA499CA8F
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
0x21A950AC
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
0x3895E4A5
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
0x7055B78C

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
0xAB3851A2
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
0x7FAD4478
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
0x46BBD2F7
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
0x4C1B426D
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
0xFF4E9815
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
0xD1654002
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
0x2C5D67B9
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
0x32B7BB1D
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
0x7FD0C153
girls.
0xFA1D3BCE

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
0x99499CF1
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
0x0EB1266C
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
0x37E18121

0xDB06C2B2
"Doubtless."
0xE09FBC27

0xDB06C2B2
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
0x8FE0EC64
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
0x678591B5

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
0x97D4476D
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
0x55A5AC9A
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
0xC4CD1815
it and disposed for full holiday."
0xA2982DC3

0xDB06C2B2
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
0xF8EA8331
What are you going to do?"
0x36D21B39

0xDB06C2B2
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
0x771B304E
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
0xF7AF18C4

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you want her?"
0xD9B76C5C

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
0x84281682
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
0x76D30F04

0xDB06C2B2
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
0x533FE7B4
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
0xEA0551FE

0xDB06C2B2
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
0xBBA7B171
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
0xB6995354

0xDB06C2B2
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
0xDAD89E80
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
0xC50D5621
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
0xEC10126B
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
0x423EA8B1
now?"
0xF07ADA28

0xDB06C2B2
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
0x79ADC95B
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
0x43E1AE3C
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
0x674C9824
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
0xED8DAEDC
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
0x5352265A
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
0x6F47546B
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
0xE3ADFBDF
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
0x03568666
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
0xD70F30E9
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
0x00FCAAFB
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
0x632790BD
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect
0x7F1C7D28
state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
0x812F5692
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."
0xAB52BD9F

0xDB06C2B2
St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
0x77565A08

0xDB06C2B2
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
0x1F68A8D2
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
0xF0C315B2
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
0x05432979

0xDB06C2B2
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.
0x997584AB

0xDB06C2B2
"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to
0x61D6B47B
make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
0x44E1A391

0xDB06C2B2
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
0xD51722FA

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
0x94E8A6C7
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
0xE95595E8
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
0x8E99543A
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
0x72F93E22
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your
0xDBAD89E8
energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
0x79B9D2FB

0xDB06C2B2
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
0x38508DE9
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
0xEA052A4F
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
0x25EF7DA6

0xDB06C2B2
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
0x34838660
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
0xC4F65ED4
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
0x2DD2208A
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
0x432DB3CE
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
0x6E54750F
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
0xD707ECED
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
0x770D3116
hear, Jane?"
0x4470D2E1

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
0x70AA330D
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
0x2D501212

0xDB06C2B2
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
0x2586B204
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
0x213C5C4F
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
0x81AD5A8B
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
0xE3F10903
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
0xDF41B693
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
0x8986D8BE
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
0x9673B53A
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
0xD277B1D6
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
0x6C213F12
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
0x9C697215
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
0x2C55D50C
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
0xEF98C3C2
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
0xBED6E288
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
0xB79D53D5
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
0xBE2CE510
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
0x2F4FBAB0
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
0x58950F1E
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
0xC0A8231B
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
0xEECF9FC9
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
0xA632B16C
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
0xB0AFE28E
without.
0xFA8ED9BB

0xDB06C2B2
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
0x0633FDA0
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
0xDFAC0FC5
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
0xFF2DE82A

0xDB06C2B2
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
0x99DAD554
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
0xFE1C6F78
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
0xC55B7441
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
0x7661C4BE
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
0x0212B0B7
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
0x9D065194
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
0x08F0D8E7
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
0x11A8003E
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
0x8838D3FD
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
0x9EF9BB11
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
0x3CB4A96F
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
0x5E9138D9
improved aspect of his abode.
0x7686D5DB

0xDB06C2B2
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
0xBA5F9133
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
0xE95F728F
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
0x8068697E

0xDB06C2B2
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
0x6A47BC69
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
0xA3260750
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
0xA77FFD11
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
0x15C6BBD4
could I tell him where such a book was?"
0x2A3B829B

0xDB06C2B2
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
0x9C860BC1
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
0xF105F565

0xDB06C2B2
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
0x71BB8D3D
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
0x76D686E1
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
0xCE545621
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
0x1ADC5AF9
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
0xA77D90F1
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
0xE30C98A4
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
0x98422F66
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
0xF24260BE
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
0xCD34FD24
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
0xABD0991C
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
0xCE305168
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
0xA58C7118
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
0xE327CD22
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
0x8EFCB6A4
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
0xB6B0C82E
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
0x98385358
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
0x936E44F8
column, gloomy and out of place.
0xF3FE1F2A

0xDB06C2B2
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
0x9379DB88
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
0x8B7DD21C
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
0xAA360114
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
0x8899804E
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
0xB380F509
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
0xC7A13AB9
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
0x6FCDD65D
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
0x5E2B95EC
career--I see it now."
0xE541DE03

0xDB06C2B2
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
0x04986FFB
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
0x96CD5456
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
0x3F488D55
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
0xBA035D80
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
0x12DDD8E8
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
0x9C0FDFC0
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
0x7DF8DC99
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
0x8D464F75
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
0x022C66EE
into the house.
0x12C4B91F

0xDB06C2B2
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
0x52660271
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
0x8BC198A9
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
0xC38A8D13
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
0xB449F28E
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
0x1412F093
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
0xAEA9FA45
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
0x0C0726DA
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
0x820DC4B7

0xDB06C2B2
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
0x06942F91
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
0x15E7C149
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
0xDAA640C8
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
0x9C91AA5D
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
0xCBE50197
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
0x1447E78C
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
0x5F332292

0xDB06C2B2
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
0x6D8CD9DB
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
0xBF07E4B6
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
0xF641A651
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
0x5EF674B7
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
0x431242E3
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
0x2FD3B955
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
0x57409F13
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
0x23920FDF
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
0x3EC610B8
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
0xCE2F3974
mother, who was drawing away."
0xBB06AACE

0xDB06C2B2
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
0xD1E79F6B

0xDB06C2B2
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
0x01618471
the way."
0xFAFF3F78

0xDB06C2B2
"Tell him I will go."
0xE6A8F500

0xDB06C2B2
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
0x6898A38B
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
0xE6646030
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
0xEA8D9BB6
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
0x4071D9E2

0xDB06C2B2
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
0x5CFA6E24
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
0xBADD0F31
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
0x276FF1BB
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
0x95163E11
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
0x04FCE38B
with himself.
0xCDB7E4A6

0xDB06C2B2
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
0x8D8E92D1
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
0x85729868
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
0x8506C56E
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
0x6AF91171
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
0x0197F74B
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
0x02B4559D
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
0x3B72BF9F
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
0xB4B7E3E3
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
0xDAA464EF
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
0xE0F425E4
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
0xDC98652E

0xDB06C2B2
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
0xC39EF559
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
0xD78CD631

0xDB06C2B2
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
0x7C39D123
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
0x7580BAF8
ensuing year.
0x1FB71674

0xDB06C2B2
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
0xA054C027
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
0x61DC2044
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
0xF79B90B5
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
0x18174DA4

0xDB06C2B2
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
0xECB1D88E
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
0xB5230255
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
0x578E9E69
yesterday."
0x38F8BE69

0xDB06C2B2
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
0x7C66A5BC
he was serene as glass.
0xC9472C64

0xDB06C2B2
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
0x65307BC1
known each other long."
0xD3099BEF

0xDB06C2B2
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
0xA92F4F6F
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
0x81F34D32
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
0xE83DF406
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
0x221F364A
can he refitted for their reception."
0x85BCF0DF

0xDB06C2B2
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
0x33E62E76
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
0x05F7AEE8
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
0x043EC741
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
0x22BF7F5A
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
0x8F1F0E2A
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
0x95F66A96
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
0xDF82DEC8
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
0xFB9F4C39
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
0x3557781C
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
0x3FD8F96B
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
0xE95F943D
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
0x2F865E3C
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
0x2EC994B7
frigidity.
0xDC4857C5

0xDB06C2B2
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
0x635B9371
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
0xFED2E54B

0xDB06C2B2
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
0x69A96F59

0xDB06C2B2
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
0x265306D9
moment's hesitation I answered--
0xC8C59321

0xDB06C2B2
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
0x93098F63
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
0xE16ED3DF

0xDB06C2B2
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
0x2033BB0B
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
0xD03439F5
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
0xEFF83ECE
returned to his papers and his silence.
0x6E60828A

0xDB06C2B2
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
0xD2A0A5FA
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
0xA1227730
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
0x9620D879
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
0x17361220
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
0x1CE77D0A
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
0x6119D0E5
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
0x29CCDB08
plans.
0x3C670ABC

0xDB06C2B2
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
0x40F3E24A
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
0xFFA09DFD
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
0x0675A579
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
0x109B4C24
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
0x48EAF782
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
0xF08AB7A1
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
0xBE56F3E9
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
0x9E158A17
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
0x326CAF3D
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
0xA3F9533F
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
0xBB8E2106
the task without regard to the elements.
0x0DCE9831

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
0xCCDC1CD1
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
0x64ADFFCA
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
0x80E1B47C
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
0xE9DDA9E7

0xDB06C2B2
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
0xC95C6890
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
0xCB0871D8
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
0x11080EDC
was a special annoyance.
0x9E23230D

0xDB06C2B2
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
0xEF475747
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
0x3F6EF42E
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
0xC4A6CCE7
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
0x5725E74F
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
0x1DD70979
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
0xA4F32A15
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
0x7A760D72
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
0x3D8A4EF7

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, what are you doing?"
0x69FDA0C7

0xDB06C2B2
"Learning German."
0x3F3229D8

0xDB06C2B2
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
0xB52A9D89

0xDB06C2B2
"You are not in earnest?"
0x368E4344

0xDB06C2B2
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
0x3C7BB2AB

0xDB06C2B2
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
0x5598AF25
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
0x91D5C141
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
0x733610B5
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
0x3E8944BC
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
0x59534D0F
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
0xB76F0A59
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
0xBEB0D4CE
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
0x2EEA7EC6
barely three months to his departure.
0x1EAD718F

0xDB06C2B2
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
0x6B437825
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
0x7B968EA6
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
0x45C02410
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
0xC017D313
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
0x5949E72C
such a step.  He answered quietly--
0xAC5DCD26

0xDB06C2B2
"I know it."
0x43BFEF1F

0xDB06C2B2
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
0xA7CBCA8C
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
0x952648E5
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
0x09161850
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
0x9F47906D
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
0xD8BF52C7
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
0xC669F204
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
0xFFD1E0C6
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
0x7499FCC5
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
0x91C44264
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
0x27A9FAD7
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
0x6BF17333
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
0x1A96B1DD

0xDB06C2B2
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
0xDEB7A314
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
0x25C3F0CA
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
0xA6237B94
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
0x7CB67B9C
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
0x616793F0

0xDB06C2B2
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
0xC83E08A4
her as such: you should kiss her too."
0xD0950A37

0xDB06C2B2
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
0x4C5F10C5
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
0x2B91F6CE
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
0x2AC389AF
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
0xF1DA1EE7
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
0xB399D784
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
0xF7C9B41A
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
0x7906BBAC
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
0x8FF02900
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
0x46696A53
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
0xBA352660
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
0xF5CE2ABC
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
0x8A51FE53

0xDB06C2B2
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
0x19F62A55
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
0x2FF22DB2
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
0x2CAB56FE
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
0x1F4550B8
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
0xC461B368
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
0x3A740F49
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
0x854AF8C6
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
0x23BC9CE9
own.
0x611DB026

0xDB06C2B2
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
0xCC968F4F
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
0xB1F76964
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
0x40DABD57

0xDB06C2B2
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
0x2D4976DF
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
0x79F79A92
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
0x86E71697
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
0xDB5C16F8
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
0x1FA586C3
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
0x5CDF1DA1
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
0xA5FCD90E
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
0xF631D664

0xDB06C2B2
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
0x5175F448
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
0x68F26AF6
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
0x2E7F3DF9
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
0xFB3BD47C
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
0x9BC7E593
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
0x8B538F37
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
0xDBF00795
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
0xEC9286DB
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
0x30BA3821

0xDB06C2B2
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
0x1F06E487
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
0xD55A0FF3
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
0xA7EDA805
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
0x8829976B
then I felt dark indeed.
0x2DEBEE5A

0xDB06C2B2
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
0x03AE1E81
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
0x6380A9BD
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
0xA7B23CB8
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
0x7C946E85
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
0xBB6020C6
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
0xF6C87378
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
0x3EFA035F
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
0xD97EFDB1

0xDB06C2B2
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
0x98CA14BD
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
0x98FDD8A4
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
0xD4D0920F
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
0x9947D8D2
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
0xC407846F
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
0xEF16FEC5
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
0x21A9A8E2
eyes filled again.
0xD31CE54E

0xDB06C2B2
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
0xFFBD791A
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
0x01CFE098
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
0x6857E972
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
0xC4C05E5D
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
0xAB61710E
as to its cause; he only said--
0x559EC0E7

0xDB06C2B2
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
0xE7396186
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
0x00E28319
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
0x3B04C31D
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
0x9798E70D
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
0xCB30D89E
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
0xD36ABEBA
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
0x165E5C5E
said--
0xF0D0D532

0xDB06C2B2
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
0xD0D2C566

0xDB06C2B2
"I will call Diana and Mary."
0x941B991E

0xDB06C2B2
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
0x532E5966
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
0x8D398F99
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
0x49970AF9

0xDB06C2B2
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
0xEB092D7E
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
0xAE944B95
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
0x7B887BEF
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
0xBC6AAB9E
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
0xB9EF2873
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
0x59E3BB6B
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
0xAC1D2AF2
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
0xC8EE7BB7

0xDB06C2B2
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
0x0A6C0497
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
0x1D22AA0A
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
0xC7745BE9
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
0x80C02A9A
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
0x8758A366
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
0x88F80E16
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
0xF75684E0
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
0xC5A96AD0

0xDB06C2B2
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
0x647972CB
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
0x26067AD9
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
0x33A7C403
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
0x62DBFCD0
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
0x824A7734
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
0xEDE37C75
last refuge for silence.
0x0CD7547F

0xDB06C2B2
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
0x17698A63
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
0xE10771F7
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
0x0D824E9B
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
0x922830F5
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
0x8FA04442

0xDB06C2B2
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
0x6CCF6FCB
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
0x45F406AB
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
0xA1AB64E9

0xDB06C2B2
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
0xA08D79F2
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
0x96CEB759
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
0x5B1B87E8

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
0x8AA60ADB
sails on the 20th of June."
0x81CF2078

0xDB06C2B2
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
0xC5B7EF90

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
0xD30C92B9
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
0xFFA8C044
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
0x61A0E8DF
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
0xFA90D3A9
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
0xB14E922B
same enterprise."
0x088E9C9B

0x92B91694

"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,

The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
0xF3E1EC9C
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
0x1B197DA9
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no

0xE93DAC2A

0xDB06C2B2

0x2265AA45
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
0xE106068D

0xDB06C2B2
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
0x4E9B1A97
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
0x2AA8EC51
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall

"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
0x1DD72049

0xDB06C2B2
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
0x19A27CE5
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
0x1695BD13
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
0xFB64D836
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
0xFCC05AAB
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
0x197A24D7

0x27927C33

0xDB06C2B2
"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
0x4E42C036
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
0x507BAEF7
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
0x1D6298F8
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
0x038E3939
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
0x92348513
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
0x431B036F
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
0x1B5F1EC0

0xBA54F620
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.

"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
0xF15F1A2E
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
0xFFD69330
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
0x8B35EFE5
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
0x930EF69D
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
0xE36C3315
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
0x88E1F60F
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
0xC8142ADD
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
0x701CE512
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
0x1A1BB447
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
0x99D8CB7D
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
0xF8D98C12
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
0x5C4CFAC7
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
0xE9D87A29
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
0xE79EFEDD
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
0xE4B72CBD
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
0xF3168531
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
0x9856DB47
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
0x8FE1FF7A
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
0xF8FB6328
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
0xC904F0A3
be to me invaluable."
0x83A2F2CC

0xDB06C2B2
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
0x344B678C
step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
0xD48D8E9B
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My
0x9ADCCDE0
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
0xA6EB02A5
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
0xA15BEF38
hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to
0x0C7E2462
think, before I again hazarded a reply.
0xFD3A41D3

0xDB06C2B2
"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up
0xCB27C24B

"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
0x4CD01E3D
that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
0x78EDE39F
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
0xF9A7F878
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
0xB2D0DE0B
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
0x3DBE8045
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
0x11EFFF8A
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
0xDD107AF5
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
0x5C2D03F9
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
0x61DD0BD7
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
0x614DAE53
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
0x5D8EB922
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
0x8FE66E99
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
0x186D4378
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
0xAEA80DA8
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
0xEDB16ED5
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
0x5965516E
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
0x1AF7836A
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
0x09D7A087
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
0xEDF94748
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
0xA723E01A
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
0x8D236D57
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
0xB2211DB4
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
0x0A80AEDE
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
0x224FE49E
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
0x25839AEE
can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.
0x91DA60A8

0xDB06C2B2
"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful
0x0A9B2A13
item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
0x992B39AC
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
0x82690B67
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
0x2EAEC1AA
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
0x2F3F2102
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
0x2A017C46
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the
0xD16A0D5E
bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
0xDED3EC46
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
0xF700ECD1
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
0x26657280
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will
0xFDF91956
never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:
0xC6577ED1
I will tell him so."
0xF54CA50B

0xDB06C2B2
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
0x80B89F88
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to
0x77AEEB5E
his feet and approached me.
0x53A54438

0xDB06C2B2
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."

"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
0x55D096D0

0xDB06C2B2
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let
0xBA29FB68
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
0x27DCA360

0xDB06C2B2
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you
0x9C8C9E85
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
0x99B014EF
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
0x1F6D6355
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
0x135BDED2
any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong
0x262DDC49
sense will guide you."
0x346C8156

0xDB06C2B2
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
0xE7908BF0
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
0xCCD765E6
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I
0xCA0D46F7
returned, "I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us
0x85B0DAA0
continue."
0x8F654977

0xDB06C2B2
"We cannot--we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it
0x2F5E3A63
would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you
0x41458E5F
have said that."
0x33C7377A

0xDB06C2B2
"Conditionally."
0x682CAC05

0xDB06C2B2
"Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the
0xF0B8E28D
co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have
0x7CC44C11
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
0xE370EB0C
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have
0xC3CAE8EF
undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,
0x65FE0598
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
0x3DACEA33
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your
0x62E7A070
great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that
0x1925BDC1
is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
0xFBB7D8D8
might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
0xA5C84159
influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
0x6413519B

0xDB06C2B2
I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on
0x9B8BF891
my limbs.
0x24FC208C

0xDB06C2B2
"Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
0xD39878DC

0xDB06C2B2
"One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.  Again I tell
0xCBFD7D1C
you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with
0x35B9A958
the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
0x266B99DE

0xDB06C2B2
"And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not
0x60C9A0D4
myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For
0x7676701B
them he has no use: I retain them."
0xB56F4B7E

0xDB06C2B2
"You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half
0x078A8F19
an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of
0x1E0ACEE0
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
0x314124D6
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
0x102026ED

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."

0xDB06C2B2
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
0xCD314CFB
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
0x2E47E5ED
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
0x64435A3C
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
0x0B4B7303
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
0xDF0C9879
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
0xB7A9C382
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
0x63937E4B
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
0x246A214B
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
0xF329BE74
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
0x1A1E55D6
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
0x6F9E84F1
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
0x04D1E4EB
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
0xEF896EFF

0xDB06C2B2
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
0xE6C7E3B9
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
0x6FF2A262

0xDB06C2B2
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
0xB506611B
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
0x1A260B92
this signify?"
0xC3F70D9F

0xDB06C2B2
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
0x29FDA003
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
0x8EAAA4F7
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
0x90951C5F
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
0xE1CAC088
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
0x113BAE3B
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
0xA269CDE0
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
0x09EC286C
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
0xCA97EE80
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
0x3FC2B315
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
0x53406E39
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
0x220289B1
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
0xE2DC4F5B
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
0xB46B0519

0xDB06C2B2
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
0x2B3B2CA1
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
0xFB6A431F
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
0x785F0F88
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
0x9D4E7AFA
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
0x721EAE07
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
0xACC5EAD7
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
0x7925461E
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
0x76671547
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
0x4E0FB6A6
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
0x8682789E
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
0x99B6FA52
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
0x69213C5C
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
0x1237F36A
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
0x001A10C3
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
0x3E3F1AA7
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
0x23A9D089
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
0xE0C5CFD9
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
0xFA3D7369
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
0xE1A2AC3C
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
0x3F887F9D
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
0x1A6FCC1A
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.

0xDB06C2B2
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
0x347B1B7B

0xDB06C2B2
"Well?" he answered icily.
0x18D0BB61

0xDB06C2B2
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
0x61CB383B
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
0x03A2A003

0xDB06C2B2
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
0xCDE40353
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
0x47659E07
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
0x6DEC5C66
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
0x1175E4F1
tribes--and unwed?"
0x7F9F9C5E

0xDB06C2B2
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
0xDEC86F17
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
0xFE3C5C7B
yourself."
0xCD775D9D

0xDB06C2B2
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
0x433FC89E
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
0xC89906A1
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
0x28AF77CF
heart and--it would not do."
0xCA11EA9A

0xDB06C2B2
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
0xFA68AB63

0xB3EFD75C
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
0xA6E5010F
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
0xD9D8854B
nothing more--don't fear."
0x9AFA2486

0xDB06C2B2
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
0xBC7739B8
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
0x4071A4AD
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be

"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
0x45D42955
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
0xBF307875
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
0xDCDE9B67
offer it."
0x542BAABE

0xDB06C2B2
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
0x871F6A5F
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
0x972FA751
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
0xE756543F

0xDB06C2B2
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
0x59178850
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
0x8F263AB0

0xDB06C2B2
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
0x6C8E8E23

0xDB06C2B2
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
0xA955D63C
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
0xBFDFD836
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
0x94D638BC
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
0x8B22D160
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
0x7C8AE08A
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
0x5BDA7A32

0xDB06C2B2
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
0x65D81115
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
0x970A67C5
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
0x9EF5038C
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
0xB9223BEE
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
0x1D4DA057
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
0x9D2B7928
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
0x19F62A12
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
0x9CF505F9
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
0x31D24353
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
0xBBB99F28

0xDB06C2B2
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
0x213E3DCF

0xDB06C2B2
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
0x05B597B5

0xDB06C2B2
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
0x0DCE836A
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
0xB2716338
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
0x4EB5DA12
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
0x95DF8256
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
0xF95E6905
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
0x254E4903
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
0xC486E5D5
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
0x61E5BA77
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
0xC3D35296

0xDB06C2B2
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
0x80793F8D
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
0x3BFAB0C6
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
0x80376A21
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
0xC6166975

0xDB06C2B2
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
0x0025CF70
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
0x9CF0F7D2
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
0xEC97FE27

0xDB06C2B2
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
0x08D7DD6B
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
0x5EB1C6A6
stairs.
0xD7E9B442

0xDB06C2B2
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
0xED749748

0xDB06C2B2
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
0x0576C607

0xDB06C2B2
"Then shake hands," I added.
0x05C7DA2D

0xDB06C2B2
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
0x50549CF6
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
0x47C55867
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
0x25F7838F
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
0x9AB7D220
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
0x38AEDDA7
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
0x4234CFE2
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
0xAEE59778

0xDB06C2B2
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
0x1D67AC23
down.
0x2F77B9D5

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
CHAPTER XXXV
0x80EF1919

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
0x881112E3
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
0x20AFEE98
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
0x326FA32A
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
0x342BD76C
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
0x2E020E97
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
0x59852A68

0xDB06C2B2
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
0x7D934AC5
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
0x7F4D19C3
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
0x86A1EADA
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
0x4A4F4C3A
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
0x54096C31
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
0xEEF7BD3D
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
0x2CAD2FD5
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
0x5891AF24
echo toned every answer he gave me.
0x4EF757F1

0xDB06C2B2
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
0xD32FD4A6
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
0x92CE6FC8
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
0x91819F2A
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
0x6CB55C62
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
0xF5288D1A
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
0x75F0C692
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
0xF4659A52
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
0xA630F897
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
0x2A307F97

0xDB06C2B2
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
0xB0C5CEDB
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
0xC645AC6B
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
0xF50EE231
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
0x2CD8F12D
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
0x8A42E39C
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
0x97B6147B
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
0x218FCD80
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
0x78E3C80D
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
0x5E52373A
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
0x44BC3FE9
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
0x1B70274B
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
0x8C3A135B
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
0xA1EAFED5
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
0xD3C27F72
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
0x4271A5C5

0xDB06C2B2
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
0x2413BBD3
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
0x16CADC78
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
0xABC515A6
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
0x82C99DD6
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
0xA53D1B96
spoke to the point at once.
0x6069862C

0xDB06C2B2
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
0x6670E7F4
friends."
0x5315AE72

0xDB06C2B2
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
0x82D21B81
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
0xA42D3097

0xDB06C2B2
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
0x27B1F51F

0xDB06C2B2
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
0x51792D2F
good."
0xCD74269E

0xDB06C2B2
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
0x6F5E066B
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
0x7ADED9E3
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
0x29F3EF6D
strangers."
0x338A0587

0xDB06C2B2
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
0x67C5D9AC
regarding you as a stranger."
0x225C8905

0xDB06C2B2
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
0x9F8C555F
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
0x32D6C6C4
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
0x54213498
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
0x48B4516C
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
0x4E6AF8B3
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
0x66CE0CFB

0xDB06C2B2
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
0x2353AC09
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
0x6F85500F

0xDB06C2B2
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
0xD644A7DB

0xDB06C2B2
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
0x137B11E5
India?"
0xA174ED3C

0xDB06C2B2
"You said I could not unless I married you."
0x951A3DBE

0xDB06C2B2
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
0x99D3FF3E

0xDB06C2B2
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
0x98AF65C6
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
0xA9F43D2B
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
0x14B9B5BB

0xDB06C2B2
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
0x6F4FF4EB

0xDB06C2B2
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
0x47E1C797
crash down.
0xDA5FF6FD

0xDB06C2B2
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
0x6479E66D

0xDB06C2B2
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
0x1C7EC4B1
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
0xED907536
You are killing me now."
0x807070E9

0xDB06C2B2
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
0xD14FEB5F

0xDB06C2B2
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
0x18C6BFAF
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
0x068282E4
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
0xE4BA274F
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
0x6413C91D
until seventy-and-seven times."
0xDA24B928

0xDB06C2B2
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
0x59F19909
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
0x1B8E1D36
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
0x80E4DDB4

0xDB06C2B2
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
0x1F618CE2
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
0x9A3FA4B6

0xDB06C2B2
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
0xD32F4E58
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
0xE491B2BC
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
0x88877C61

0xDB06C2B2
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
0x6EBCC233
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
0x71A2C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
0x9C8A9F71
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
0xAF9DF085
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
0xF1B87F49

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
0x709FA409

0xDB06C2B2
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
0x0BB58362
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
0x604FCDC7
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
0x98F06E2D
spoke at last.
0x4938CCDB

0xDB06C2B2
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
0xAE1B56D4
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
0x2F6694EB
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
0xB3839808
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
0x4A4D8042
sake."
0xFA389A86

0xDB06C2B2
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
0x08C4D4B1
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
0x32B180AC
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
0x98145249
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
0x08E7009A
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
0x9C755469
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
0xD72159D0

0xDB06C2B2
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
0x9B30B9BB
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
0xE751C8B0

0xDB06C2B2
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
0xDA5DDB70
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
0x37578CFF
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
0x571769F5
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
0xFF9D2A5D
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
0xC6969262
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
0xD979FB82

0xDB06C2B2
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
0xDC1B7339
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
0x0D35690A
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
0xF6B236C6

0xDB06C2B2
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
0x9B373598
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
0x6851B956
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
0x3B3FF88B
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
0x2C38558B
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
0xFF6729FD

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
0x04CB0FE9

0xDB06C2B2
"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
0x7D1BF252
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
0xDF2DD30C
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
0x0CEB04B1
for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by
0xA1CF634D
leaving it."
0xA244C37F

0xDB06C2B2
"What do you mean?"
0x49FFBBEA

0xDB06C2B2
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
0x5E474D0D
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
0x96D995F9
some means that doubt is removed."
0x05AED84E

0xDB06C2B2
"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
0x4CCCD7A0
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
0x85E22B31
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.
0xF5BDD38B
Rochester?"
0xFE16AF7F

0xDB06C2B2
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.
0xC193A6DD

0xDB06C2B2
"Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"
0x4C45B3F7

0xDB06C2B2
"I must find out what is become of him."
0x71592ED6

0xDB06C2B2
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
0x182BA5EA
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
0xFD4C9364
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
0x0E10A96C
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--"
0xD2C8826C

0xDB06C2B2
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
0x3FC4B839
was soon out of sight.
0xAB14B7BC

0xDB06C2B2
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
0x0E906C70
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
0x3CA0FAD4
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
0x853C287D

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
0x45CD6DFE
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
0x5FFDC81D
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
0x69EBB0AA
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
0x8F5CB5C3
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
0x3C0883B6

0xDB06C2B2
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--
0x0B193A31

0xDB06C2B2
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
0x6480E0BC
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
0x93A9469A
never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he,
0xEE0587AE
Jane?"
0x57F73931

0xDB06C2B2
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
0x10DA93C9

0xDB06C2B2
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
0xFF3B6EC1
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
0xFB458BBF
both concluded he wished you to marry him."
0x804CB92A

0xDB06C2B2
"He does--he has asked me to be his wife."
0xA31D7499

0xDB06C2B2
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And
0xE1C3C873
you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
0x1DE5977B

0xDB06C2B2
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
0xF001B9E4
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
0x7620BADD

0xDB06C2B2
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
0xA406BF34

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
0x61536BC0
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
0xA595E41F

0xDB06C2B2
"I have refused to marry him--"
0x059F7631

0xDB06C2B2
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
0x151DF8ED

0xDB06C2B2
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
0xB2B09BF8
as his sister."
0x8AFB8FD9

0xDB06C2B2
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
0x0D184BFB
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
0x5A236FC4
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
0xFCB215C4
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
0x24E678E4
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
0xA35CC2E5
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
0xEF74D224
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
0x315D11F2

0xDB06C2B2
"Not as a husband."
0x939889A0

0xDB06C2B2
"Yet he is a handsome fellow."
0xAEF1786F

0xDB06C2B2
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit."
0x60A63E2E

0xDB06C2B2
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
0xBBA0E333
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
0xB2B8398F
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
0x7A6C1B59

0xDB06C2B2
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
0xCB88E16B
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
0xB41E0A4C
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
0xFE5CE9E1
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
0xADDB5FEF
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
0xB0216259

0xDB06C2B2
"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
0xB413CA44

0xDB06C2B2
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
0x82A68B99
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
0x8E2BBA80
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
0xA2D1FAA2
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
0x47EC0BDD
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
0x737E6C61
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
0x63AEFBB4

0xDB06C2B2
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
0xF945EB49

0xDB06C2B2
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
0x5BD1ECAB
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
0x1C04E030
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
0x216E48CE
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
0xC8E4B421
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
0xE094A1D1
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
0x246087C9
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
0xDD0841DF
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
0x7FFBDFF3

0xDB06C2B2
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
0xEBC743A5

0xDB06C2B2
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
0xD6B933D8
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
0xD771006E
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
0xCC1D14D4
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
0x79309598
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
0xC3A5F9C1

0xDB06C2B2
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
0x59B175D4
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
0x7FA12455
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
0x3D9B120A
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
0x252FA512
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
0x3B2E4F39
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
0xAA2B3AA3
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
0x6C175F14
had forgiven me once more.
0x1EDB7011

0xDB06C2B2
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
0xC2A8C12E
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
0xEAD8354C
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
0x805A0988
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
0x5560374F
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
0x42D7F799
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
0x0FAFDB66
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
0x43075A22
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
0x42BEEA2A
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
0x57028E3A
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
0xE967D472
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
0x78613328
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
0x852C0652
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
0xDF791F2D
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
0xF6052692

0xDB06C2B2
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
0xE3E22ADA
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
0x3B94E2AE
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
0xCAB05E83

0xDB06C2B2
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
0x89F91D09
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
0xCACDF64D
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
0x965E9E12
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
0x8F0943BF

0xDB06C2B2
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
0xEB92B7EC

0xDB06C2B2
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
0xFC32CED1
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
0x2F7D169C
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
0x2D8C0989
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
0xB9948B98
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
0x1791D6D2
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
0xE8DE3428
Lamb is the light thereof.
0xCCCA47AC

0xDB06C2B2
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
0xCE1E6A66
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
0x0E507539
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
0x4FDB1E44
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
0xBB7338A4
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
0x2B27871E
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
0x537063E9
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
0xCAE50AF5
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
0x5E3E9317
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
0xDA30384B
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
0xE8C25E1F
could not but feel it too.
0xE5CD6948

0xDB06C2B2
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
0x33196D99
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
0x93D8C6BB
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
0x43E0075B
and wished him a pleasant journey.
0x3351D4C3

0xDB06C2B2
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
0x936112BE
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
0x4599E644
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
0x02CBDFA5
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
0x84B87204
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
0x9F6588D2
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
0x6DEFCED2
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
0x5C6AD5DD
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
0x9F90EF20
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
0x3771FA97
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
0xD1D72116
from you!"
0xEABF0A8B

0xDB06C2B2
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
0xCE30A83E
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
0x29D52FDF
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
0x16A825D0
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
0x371AB1EF
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
0x9C94AC36
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
0x40BE4436
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
0x26E63BD7
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
0xDCE05E95
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
0x9E4C2E72
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
0x2986634E
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
0xB1029C04
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
0x88D9ECE9
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
0x9799082D
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
0xD0021969
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
0xC9B56317
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
0xCDA56E36

0xDB06C2B2
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
0xE1CC755C
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
0x13F77032
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
0xA42FFAD6
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
0x872786BF
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
0x5FA6C6FF
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
0x5B7F8103
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
0xCE714EE9
dim room was full of visions.
0x7BF68DD5

0xDB06C2B2
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
0x07FE59DF
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
0x6230276B
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
0xFF9D11ED
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
0x523F473F
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
0xFB70E0A1
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
0xB68A6EC4
prayer: it was only elevated.
0xE715666A

0xDB06C2B2
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
0x87A673FD
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
0xDE651A9A
and now--come afterwards what would!"
0x80A528D9

0xDB06C2B2
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
0x25445BF6
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
0x2E3E110B
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
0xDF1D3DFD
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
0x8A3E73CC
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
0x68BDCB8F
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
0xE0603852
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
0x1045C715
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
0xEDB597BC
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
0xBE9E1341
shall judge.
0xF7FC4B2F

0xDB06C2B2
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
0xA195B3BD
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
0x9F7DBDF9
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
0x3546064A
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
0x82A84F43
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
0xFD3945CD
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
0x4D183A65
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
0x37A5C34A
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
0x393AFCED
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
0xEF227065
bones.
0x09027F32

0xDB06C2B2
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
0x1088F38F
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
0x35001695

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
0xB8BDCB6A

0xDB06C2B2
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
0xA0B40E8F

0xDB06C2B2
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
0x9C721077
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
0x9158B23E
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
0xD9BA959E
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
0xF80D9A10
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
0xB71FBE22
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
0xD47AC988

0xDB06C2B2
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
0xFC83292B
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
0xC34D7760
garden: it was void.
0xBE213006

0xDB06C2B2
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
0x3C4EA84A

0xDB06C2B2
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
0xFFF21881
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
0xF058AFF0
loneliness and midnight hush.
0xBF1BC8AF

0xDB06C2B2
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
0xDA515DB8
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
0x6F9B886F
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
0xC7DC6F8E
best."
0xC0552AA4

0xDB06C2B2
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
0x86761760
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
0x6187A743
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
0xA221FBF3
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
0x4516E414
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
0x74D3965F
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
0x8CE3C9BF
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
0xD085183E
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
0x67398044
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
0x721D11B7
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.

CHAPTER XXXVI
0xF0929873

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
0x46A84B5E
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
0xBD943B3C
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
0x6CE30C7B
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
0x1CA0A354
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
0xCB38C68E
I took it up.  It bore these words--
0xE4D438B6

0xDB06C2B2
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
0x83B7A399
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
0xE2FADB1D
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
0x215DDF99
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
0x28C7F963
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
0x511DE389
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
0xE48F077B

0xDB06C2B2
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
0x9855D198
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
0x796D214A
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
0xB1BF2631
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
0x5A72ACE0
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
0xB6B66C9E

0xDB06C2B2
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
0xFB2D53D4
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
0xAF562316
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
0xA5BB45B1
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
0x4760389C
would meet the coach.
0xAD2D3151

0xDB06C2B2
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
0x500C2105
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
0x5416E11D
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
0x09977567

0xDB06C2B2
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
0x824D8947
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
0x27509947
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
0x1D7AAF2F
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
0x54E0F772
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
0x4C1B45D4
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
0x6462E1EF
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
0xA587457E
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
0x2ABB531A
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
0x16AC90A7
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
0x6346896E
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
0x16619410
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
0x64AEC1CA
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
0x84B57C39
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
0xAA40DD24
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
0x617D00EA
body.
0x3270DCBF

0xDB06C2B2
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
0x415B32EC
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
0x7E242330
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
0x1A67E738

0xDB06C2B2
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
0x667C8985
and should be absent at least four days.
0x888EA5D3

0xDB06C2B2
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
0x925C79B8

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
0x71CFA53B
time been uneasy."
0x5A2E22C2

0xDB06C2B2
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
0x29FB6C0F
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
0x9B87F262
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
0x1E01B704
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
0x6AB2A37A
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
0x446C21BE
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
0x500F16D0

0xDB06C2B2
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
0x66E52D4D
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
0x4E3EA8EC
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
0x1A77F8E7
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
0x479EEDDD
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
0x8F8CD3B9

0xDB06C2B2
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
0x19F9484C
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
0x640A59A0
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
0x0A95FDD3
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
0x9C6FC78F
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
0x4CB78A65
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
0xAD005CAE
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
0xE351F55D
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
0x8ABB11A0
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
0x92AF468D

0xDB06C2B2
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
0xCBF7C85D
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
0xDC59D207
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
0x42C79F2C
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
0x437F8CA5
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
0xD875A7CF
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
0x29FAB593
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
0x375119C8
we were near my bourne.
0xB2782AEF

0xDB06C2B2
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
0xD7E6F4ED

0xDB06C2B2
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."

"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
0x2B952DE5
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
0x1AE953E7
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
0x9CED8695
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
0x89D99241
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
0x07EF6476
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
0x7E8A85AE

0xDB06C2B2
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
0x175148A4
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
0x35C0D65B
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
0x9D69C055
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
0x370FCDD8
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
0x36696C91
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
0x6C920CA7
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
0xD8912247
Mr. Rochester be at home."
0x37B8C56F

0xDB06C2B2
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
0x6C73ECCE
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
0xF1C7A0EE
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
0x89CE0441
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
0xC874AD21
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
0x556A146D
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
0xDA62E7BB
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
0x75C7458E
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
0x6D29F0AC
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
0x48C800E9
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
0xFBD55D41
them!
0xF94D75C6

0xDB06C2B2
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
0x5ED2389B
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
0x63A04091
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
0x83CF6F54
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
0xE739FFC6
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
0x9690A565
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
0x51A777D3
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
0xE39D6706
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
0xDDEBC91C
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
0xC2AF534D
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
0x2AA54BB1
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
0x43B45FDB
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
0xE847FA69
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
0xCD46EB2C
tideless sea of the south."
0xCF19D3D8

0xDB06C2B2
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
0xF49720D8
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
0xFE53B7CC
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
0x72F880ED
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
0xA2C197A6
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
0xA30277C3
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
0xE88A8AE4
station were at my command.
0x3ABB1570

0xDB06C2B2
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
0xA50C3B91
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
0xB1171B6A
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
0x5C0E230F
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
0x74EA6233
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
0x6C107CC0
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
0xA4A083DA
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
0x2504DAC5
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
0x9DCD484E

0xDB06C2B2
Hear an illustration, reader.
0xB611AB21

0xDB06C2B2
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
0x543BD569
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
0x135B3A7D
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
0xBCFA2C3A
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
0xD5ED0105
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
0x2DC68DAF
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
0x8E1EB4C6
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
0x9E3318B1
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
0x622C428D
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
0x5DB66473
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
0x61E6CFD2
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
0x3E84408A
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
0x7B90DC85
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
0x81BD6838

0xDB06C2B2
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
0xF389924D
ruin.
0xE72C9E35

0xDB06C2B2
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
0x5FF96707
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
0x977822CD
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
0x73A314BE
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
0x543FB973
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
0xF89383FF
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
0x14348A7B
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
0x09377E8D

0xDB06C2B2
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
0x1C2D346B
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
0x82F0D536
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
0x59339210
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
0xCFE14E7D
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
0x37C904E1
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
0x20E42E67
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
0xDC1346E8
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
0xAF3D500A
token.
0xCBD7E242

0xDB06C2B2
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
0xBEC326B8
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
0x19716BAF
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
0x222D977B
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
0x31742E91
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
0x4F26039E
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
0xCC029F82
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
0x484CB2EE
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
0x87892F83
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
0x9D448AA8
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
0xE6D2A9F6

0xDB06C2B2
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
0x2B5D831E
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
0x6F0F49BF
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
0xFC1D2FB5
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
0xA6340F75
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
0xE3642BCB
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
0xFC9D7647
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
0x01846490

0xDB06C2B2
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
0xB18FA1B3

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
0x04653A33

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
0xA7DEE69C

0xDB06C2B2
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
0x7A4DB106

0xDB06C2B2
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
0x2FAA651F
trying to evade.
0xCA0913D0

0xDB06C2B2
"The late!" I gasped.  "Is he dead?"
0xBAF234D6

0xDB06C2B2
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
0x86066B0A
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
0xD4C801F9
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
0x4A8153BB
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
0x9B78D097
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
0x683E8D09
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
0xCFBA5CFB
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
0xA0FCB62D
Antipodes.
0x54797BE4

0xDB06C2B2
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
0xE78B32C1
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
0x94586E54
direct question as to where he really was.
0xE8B66D16

0xDB06C2B2
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
0x4B26AA26
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
0xE78605BE
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
0x5899FAA6
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
0xA24DE96A
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
0x43CA7E29
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
0xF5C55BCD
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
0x7D1983D4
witnessed it myself."
0x0702A987

0xDB06C2B2
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
0x67D78689
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
0x23374FE0

0xDB06C2B2
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
0x66CC48A4
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
0xFDA4E4F7
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
0xEB03BD9C
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
0x6EB4D53F

0xDB06C2B2
"I have heard something of it."
0xD7BD2B38

0xDB06C2B2
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
0x4F17EA02
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
0x76228D09
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
0xED2F15AA
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
0xC2DD25AD
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
0xB97F3E24
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
0x9CA350D4

0xDB06C2B2
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
0xA35CE701
main fact.
0xD87D288A

0xDB06C2B2
"And this lady?"
0x979CE3CE

0xDB06C2B2
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
0xD05E8E3D
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
0xEABF5B65
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
0xEB702BDC

0xDB06C2B2
"But the fire," I suggested.
0x379937D4

0xDB06C2B2
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
0x78C5A056
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
0x104CCF4C
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
0x89A330FA
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
0xA0EF1D25
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
0xC5320A05
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
0x367C57AB
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
0xE1475A51
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
0x5ED40D49
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
0xB12D0B28
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
0x89F5A753

0xDB06C2B2
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
0xB9C6BCFF
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
0x90DA010F
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
0x2893D872

0xDB06C2B2
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
0xACFF5DCC
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
0xBB5091A4
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
0x91C1E610
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
0x59ECD930
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
0xEED47B15
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
0x1C3B1A39
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
0xF8BFF941
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
0xEE98FCB9
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
0x82B3BF02
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
0x0BCBA4AA
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
0xE818B031
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
0x0432FDD3
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
0xEA0117CC
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
0xE3609DCF
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
0x2BBA3C70
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
0xB4AD96F6
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
0xBC0B2D69
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
0x030F1668
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
0xB5D3FE91
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
0x1ABEA98E
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
0x69176AA5
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
0x6CD59187
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
0x309C9C9A
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
0x9ED84252
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
0xEE5AB0CE
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
0x96728A1A

0xDB06C2B2
"What! did he not leave England?"
0x7EAA285E

0xDB06C2B2
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
0x76B74486
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
0x7958FE0F
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
0xBC9EEFDC
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
0xF83388D9
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
0xB4DF605C
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
0xA03B6984
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
0x94CACF47
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
0x16BBD246
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
0x4553902B
Thornfield Hall."
0x0E12EE6B

0xDB06C2B2
"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
0xBB53F3FB

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
0xC1286B21
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
0x54D6CBD1
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
0xFC096B3A
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
0x6B5B507A
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
0x53E26D23
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
0x8D86CB54
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
0x9052E95B
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
0xFCFD86A7
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
0x0291B783
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
0x8BB769A4
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the
0x8745EC98
pavement."
0x65FFB7B7

0xDB06C2B2
{The next minute she lay smashed on the pavement: p413.jpg}
0xEE8EA181

0xDB06C2B2
"Dead?"
0x76047FB5

0xDB06C2B2
"Dead!  Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
0x8749E231
scattered."
0x62404577

0xDB06C2B2
"Good God!"
0x4A81D26E

0xDB06C2B2
"You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!"
0xCA3CA788

0xDB06C2B2
He shuddered.
0x42047544

0xDB06C2B2
"And afterwards?" I urged.
0x46FD6A35

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
0x25306D3C
only some bits of walls standing now."
0xA9D756B0

0xDB06C2B2
"Were any other lives lost?"
0x40FAE863

0xDB06C2B2
"No--perhaps it would have been better if there had."
0xC5A60378

0xDB06C2B2
"What do you mean?"
0x49FFBBEA

0xDB06C2B2
"Poor Mr. Edward!" he ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen it!
0x48D7B4F3
Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage
0x558DDB10
secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I
0x2B96A9D8
pity him, for my part."
0x0C3EFC29

0xDB06C2B2
"You said he was alive?" I exclaimed.
0x56D94874

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead."
0x94C76BA2

0xDB06C2B2
"Why?  How?"  My blood was again running cold.  "Where is he?" I
0x9256BC06
demanded.  "Is he in England?"
0x361CE1A8

0xDB06C2B2
"Ay--ay--he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy--he's a
0x669AF6FB
fixture now."
0x7E6BD024

0xDB06C2B2
What agony was this!  And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
0xA010C6A1

0xDB06C2B2
"He is stone-blind," he said at last.  "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
0x93924B19
Edward."
0x1F47AF83

0xDB06C2B2
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
0x290566B9
ask what had caused this calamity.
0xA0C93FF1

0xDB06C2B2
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
0xE5103E8B
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
0xF5F3A888
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
0x10F3ABB3
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
0xD07BF668
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
0xEC32B156
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
0x28432EAD
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
0x23A13E96
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that
0xD38D7DD4
also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."
0x041D646B

0xDB06C2B2
"Where is he?  Where does he now live?"
0xB2137930

0xDB06C2B2
"At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
0x1D47C10A
quite a desolate spot."
0x7462809C

0xDB06C2B2
"Who is with him?"
0x3F2679F9

0xDB06C2B2
"Old John and his wife: he would have none else.  He is quite broken
0x682157CC
down, they say."
0x94270575

0xDB06C2B2
"Have you any sort of conveyance?"
0x07F52137

0xDB06C2B2
"We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise."

CHAPTER XXXVII
0xC7FF232B

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
0x86A8F5B5
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
0x602F59F6
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
0x926D5D42
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
0x7C36D258
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
0xC8BC2561
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
0x221AF132
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
0xB0123522
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
0x4E33B4FC
there in the season to shoot.
0xB6E1AA5A

0xDB06C2B2
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
0xBB0E7834
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
0x212F773D
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
0x483789D2
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
0x9851C488
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
0xB7158A81
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
0xA4D81C8D
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
0x3463C74E
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
0x6E2C4748
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
0xD91AAB3C
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
0xC0410920
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
0xE0EBC752
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
0x1D6EDD79

0xDB06C2B2
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
0x106596BE
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
0x1FEE7093
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
0xE366339A
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
0x67FCFB45

0xDB06C2B2
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
0x5194265F
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
0x0051AC3A
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
0x10100E82
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
0x1FAD207F
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
0xC216286A
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
0x2D2740BC
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
0x188EB633
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
0xBA547228
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
0xB2ED514E
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
0x3DF61184
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
0x5CE52E72
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
0x87C05313

0xDB06C2B2
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
0xD6CB01F5

0xDB06C2B2
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
0x4E95895B
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
0x73790139
grange.
0x863A6619

0xDB06C2B2
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
0xBFD26B87
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
0xCCBC1948
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
0x9A5C9653
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
0xA07117BA

0xDB06C2B2
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
0xD3D4FA4B
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
0xCE0B2819
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
0x99F00E63
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
0x40B972DF
advance.
0x412A7D93

0xDB06C2B2
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
0x8D665B62
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
0x2D11E5F3
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
0xAF3240C8
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
0xFB19A746
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
0x1274FEF8
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
0x908B3688
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
0xEFB76124
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
0x76F95E12

0xDB06C2B2
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
0x6F1BBFE8
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
0xCBA4C102
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
0x941A9A68
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
0x659BBC09

0xDB06C2B2
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
0xC3EF21AC
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
0x6B84E5FF
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
0xE7E83996
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
0x42E6A91A
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
0x0D9EFBA5
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
0x6C297284
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
0xAFB0C46F
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
0x42951363
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
0x40DB4D2C
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
0xC9809C9F
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
0xEFAB9F09

0xDB06C2B2
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
0x1DF7EDAF
had you not better go in?"
0xB7E76C11

0xDB06C2B2
"Let me alone," was the answer.
0x7F44A968

0xDB06C2B2
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
0x8C0B85E5
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
0x48FE156C
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
0x351A8046

0xDB06C2B2
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
0x860F01C9
"how are you?"
0x21825ED2

0xDB06C2B2
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
0xE7C154D2
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
0x800870A3
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
0x9C16D4EF
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
0xF2A2D289
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
0x331A3DC5
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
0x63E5BA71
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
0x63554A23
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
0x1FB9916B
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
0xBF0DD4F4
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
0xF4D2ECB6
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
0xA53C3013
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
0x0B354954

0xDB06C2B2
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
0xD7933ED0
to him, but do not give my name."
0xB8F801CB

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
0xE66D1259

0xDB06C2B2
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
0xCF5D3A3C
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
0x0DEB80E8
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
0x6D4BF32E

0xDB06C2B2
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
0x700E8A4D

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
0xF1782184

0xDB06C2B2
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
0x3B228F51

0xDB06C2B2
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
0x21FF1A58
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
0x99B00C0F
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
0x049424AD

0xDB06C2B2
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
0xC291720E
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
0x228091CC
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
0x9FEAFF1F
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
0x2A604313
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
0xB9115985
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
0xF37C7BF1
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
0x88F3B06C
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
0xB8ADC395
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
0x86319E65
nothing, he returned and sighed.
0xB225BE4F

0xDB06C2B2
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
0xC7A93884

0xDB06C2B2
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
0x3FE85D81
still excited.
0x1044E0E5

0xDB06C2B2
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
0x9141DF98

0xDB06C2B2
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
0x3A63D9F4
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
0xFD860A58
you, Mary, is it not?"
0x962346E8

0xDB06C2B2
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
0x1A1B5903

0xDB06C2B2
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
0x9D497C77
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
0xD27CC5C5
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
0x75A84D61
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
0x21761457
and aloud.
0x834EA18A

0xDB06C2B2
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
0x9B233787
glass," I said.
0xA78D9F26

0xDB06C2B2
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
0xA20E232A

0xDB06C2B2
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
0xD403A3DB
evening," I answered.
0x66AECE8D

0xDB06C2B2
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
0x11054F38
seized me?"
0xE181E51C

0xDB06C2B2
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
0x3E64DA47
your health too sound for frenzy."
0x52A272CE

0xDB06C2B2
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
0xE94807DF
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
0x3D949A8C
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
0x0330AE30

0xDB06C2B2
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
0x4A80E4C3

0xDB06C2B2
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
0xF02054E0
must be more of her."
0x2FA783BE

0xDB06C2B2
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
0x752106E2
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
0xECC25D0D

0xDB06C2B2
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
0x186B5BA1

0xDB06C2B2
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
0x1F9DC14D
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
0xE6516655

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
0x28E2FA3A

0xDB06C2B2
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
0xC578D39E
come back to you."
0x1F75B897

0xDB06C2B2
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
0xAAA9CC36

0xDB06C2B2
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
0x85A11ECD
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
0xC3B4CA15

0xDB06C2B2
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
0x1C3D327A
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
0x117B0186
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
0xC929076E
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
0xBAEE3937
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
0xF51A58C4

0xDB06C2B2
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
0x7F9A1F95

0xDB06C2B2
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
0x06170EB2
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
0xA6A00E64
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
0xB7423B94
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
0x7959C56D
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
0x247793CD
you go--embrace me, Jane."
0xE8611555

0xDB06C2B2
"There, sir--and there!"'
0x7D7BB5BC

0xDB06C2B2
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
0xA0A76494
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
0x7973209C
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
0xB1598905

0xDB06C2B2
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"
0x866EE546

0xDB06C2B2
"I am."
0xA131E71F

0xDB06C2B2
"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are
0x3325981E
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
0x71AEAA35

0xDB06C2B2
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."
0x212992DC

0xDB06C2B2
"Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?"
0x2DAD0ED6

0xDB06C2B2
"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."
0x0511CFD6

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah! this is practical--this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream
0x1AEEB746
that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
0xCA4A186C
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
0xCDF8ABD1
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
0x688F7608

0xDB06C2B2
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
0xE016D207
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
0x4F36A288
company of an evening."
0x717407E8

0xDB06C2B2
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
0xF1932BD1
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
0xDE4C0706
me?"
0x2EFFBAE5

0xDB06C2B2
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
0x58842CAD
mistress."
0xB10B452F

0xDB06C2B2
"And you will stay with me?"
0xE736E5D1

0xDB06C2B2
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
0x427F7AE3
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
0xD792B4D2
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
0x6774294A
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
0x144EA3BA
be left desolate, so long as I live."
0x0737880B

0xDB06C2B2
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
0xFCAFED38
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
0xA5B36553
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
0x5337EDF1
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
0x15C78B0B
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
0x85CCE22D
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
0xD18BC82F
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
0xCC089177
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
0xA2CFF9A2
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
0x5411BF5A
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
0x87567B97
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
0x294F51E0

0xDB06C2B2
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
0x6515C153
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
0x2B32FE38
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
0xDB0C6EF9
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
0x1E89248D
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
0x5BB7E809
vengeance on its frame."
0x710C6B7D

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
0xCA86BA1C

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
0x97FC84B9
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
0x1402C2FC
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
0xC5CFE614
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
0xCCD93CED
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
0x951DB3C5
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
0xE69E6D3D
Come--tell me."
0x18F43C35

0xDB06C2B2
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
0x0F76B127
you think it better."
0xCFBD7CEA

0xDB06C2B2
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
0x016C864C
one day."
0xF392B9E0

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't care about being married."
0x36920C26

0xDB06C2B2
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
0xF8779B72
you care--but--a sightless block!"
0xBE8B0556

0xDB06C2B2
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
0xF0240A60
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
0xCEC26D7D
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
0x7C23F28E
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
0xB67E438A
conversation.
0x4308ADA5

0xDB06C2B2
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
0xFBA9CC62
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
0x5DF17F17
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
0xB80174A6
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
0xB1637193
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
0x3FAD3D04
not yet noticed."
0xDD272C66

0xDB06C2B2
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
0x4D2E79C9
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
0xD60C01B0
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
0xEA1FCE26

0xDB06C2B2
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
0x64CA1129
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
0x399BF3B7
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."
0xEF68879C

0xDB06C2B2
"I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my
0x5A5B5793
cicatrised visage."
0xEE52773B

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to
0xBFDD5AC1
your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
0x64C26DF1
and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?"
0xB9A23273

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze."
0xA3376B8F

0xDB06C2B2
"And you see the candles?"
0xF308A368

0xDB06C2B2
"Very dimly--each is a luminous cloud."
0xFEF797B5

0xDB06C2B2
"Can you see me?"
0xC719DB22

0xDB06C2B2
"No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you."
0xDE60C49B

0xDB06C2B2
"When do you take supper?"
0x0A606FC7

0xDB06C2B2
"I never take supper."
0xEA96643A

0xDB06C2B2
"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
0x770097A3
only you forget."
0xFDBA86DF

0xDB06C2B2
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
0x11918869
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
0xB17875B7
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
0x0CA8FA38
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
0x011C7353
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
0xAD7963DC
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
0xF8DE88DC
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
0xF5D7433A
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
0x80324AC4
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
0x35223E1A
lineaments softened and warmed.
0xF4066CBB

0xDB06C2B2
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
0x1AE3859A
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
0x630A6776
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
0x5D049FE5
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
0x6A70FB85
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
0x4D6A5675
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
0x5D87D40E
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."
0xD1943083

0xDB06C2B2
"You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?"
0xA9F69903

0xDB06C2B2
{You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?:
0xFBC3FB4D
p422.jpg}
0x88712D16

0xDB06C2B2
"I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester."
0xBB9ACC54

0xDB06C2B2
"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on
0x9C9F5783
my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
0x65D4639A
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
0x4E0F17DC
John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
0x90C75CD5

0xDB06C2B2
"Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray."
0xBB6CDA42

0xDB06C2B2
"And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.
0xA80ADA2D
Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
0xFEA08830
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
0x4C30CD14
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
0xF9C603DA
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
0x52E78CF5
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
0xE801A8F9
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
0xB346E157
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
0x8401A1DD
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."
0x645D0635

0xDB06C2B2
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
0x88049665
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
0x8EA71370
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
0xB074914A
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
0x8C93E672
them grow as broad and black as ever.
0x3A85BD99

0xDB06C2B2
"Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,
0x8F744F1F
at some fatal moment, you will again desert me--passing like a shadow,
0x986E2240
whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards
0xA49B5FC2
undiscoverable?
0x0683B2A3

0xDB06C2B2
"Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?"
0x7A52CFB4

0xDB06C2B2
"What for, Jane?"
0x9AE224FF

0xDB06C2B2
"Just to comb out this shaggy black mane.  I find you rather alarming,
0x45ABB0FA
when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am
0x450446F6
sure, you are more like a brownie."
0x1FE607AD

0xDB06C2B2
"Am I hideous, Jane?"
0xC48DE0FD

0xDB06C2B2
"Very, sir: you always were, you know."
0x5465B691

0xDB06C2B2
"Humph!  The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have
0x1DBB15EF
sojourned."
0x6A4F339C

0xDB06C2B2
"Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times
0xBB571A1D
better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your
0x415DCD4B
life: quite more refined and exalted."
0x869FB9C2

0xDB06C2B2
"Who the deuce have you been with?"
0xD1477724

0xDB06C2B2
"If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your
0x33EC4016
head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my
0xA4B61F7F
substantiality."
0xDDF71506

0xDB06C2B2
"Who have you been with, Jane?"
0x631F11A0

0xDB06C2B2
"You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till
0xD6AE637C
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of
0xFD87C2DF
security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By
0x4EE715A2
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
0x023C1EC9
water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried
0x85120E07
ham."
0x4B508739

0xDB06C2B2
"You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred!  You make me feel as
0xF8DE395E
I have not felt these twelve months.  If Saul could have had you for his
0xC7689B79
David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the
0xFC941F2F
harp."
0xB824AD7E

0xDB06C2B2
"There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.  Now I'll leave you: I have
0xA702DDAB
been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.  Good
0xEA6B7EA1
night."
0x3B57BF70

0xDB06C2B2
"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have
0xE2104A66
been?"
0x7E4344F2

0xDB06C2B2
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
0x8DF3A5A1
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
0xCF06EB4C
of his melancholy for some time to come."
0x2CBDC0D4

0xDB06C2B2
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
0xE1765D44
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
0xCBF2D641
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
0xF17DB31F
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."
0x5C98A229

0xDB06C2B2
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
0x82BEF16F
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
0x8FB325A5
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
0x8E1B85CF
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
0xB2DA5E1D
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
0x181CDD23
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
0xF52FE9DE
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
0x9A25849A
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
0x8469A584
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
0x871659CE
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
0xAD0F857B
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
0xF2208FFF

0xDB06C2B2
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
0x4AEFFCED
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
0xB4F69784
soon."
0x455253A9

0xDB06C2B2
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
0xBC738405

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
0x25984EF1
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
0xA7182D4F
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
0xC407659C
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
0x82871C03
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
0x6D55AE42
can feel is in her presence."
0xB334B1E5

0xDB06C2B2
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
0xACB2D4FF
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
0xB1F789D6
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
0xBCA5CE62
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
0x8CD33D2E

0xDB06C2B2
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
0xC59ACE91
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
0xECBAC1B1
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
0xD011BA47
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
0xBA0F2611
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
0x14D64D18
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
0x42E5C87B
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
0x63A12A08
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
0x705E717C

0xDB06C2B2
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
0xB913E738
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
0x63FE2C92
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
0xE32D2ADE
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
0xCA5CF75F
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
0x9812A968
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
0xECA96C00
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
0x945A9892
she do?  Let me hear now."
0x7EFC3C27

0xDB06C2B2
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
0x3F13CAE1
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
0x824306A3
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
0x38D6A7EC
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
0x971E418A
deeper than I wished.
0xCF0CC2D4

0xDB06C2B2
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
0x0920F37F
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
0x05EC7A3F
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
0x3BA22607
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
0xDB1BAEF8
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
0xDB492206
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
0x3BE0332E
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
0x6923E2AE
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
0x0D0680C5

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
0x8A056232
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
0x50F0EF5B
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
0x2FFBFC46
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
0x32043B91
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
0xE71E2E45
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
0x4504E916
up.
0xE50E124D

0xDB06C2B2
"This St. John, then, is your cousin?"
0xBDE67ECD

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"
0x261CB1A0

0xDB06C2B2
"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."
0xC2B211F8

0xDB06C2B2
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
0x2F7842D2
Or what does it mean?"
0x118E15CF

0xDB06C2B2
"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."
0x728D7ADE

0xDB06C2B2
"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
0x5C68AEDE
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
0x0085E514
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."
0xC357D628

0xDB06C2B2
"He is untiringly active.  Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to
0x067797F3
perform."
0xECA37437

0xDB06C2B2
"But his brain?  That is probably rather soft?  He means well: but you
0x494B4541
shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"
0x11F69229

0xDB06C2B2
"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain
0x23CB9FC9
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."
0x99D41932

0xDB06C2B2
"Is he an able man, then?"
0x9DE7649C

0xDB06C2B2
"Truly able."
0x756D235C

0xDB06C2B2
"A thoroughly educated man?"
0x74ED8E53

0xDB06C2B2
"St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar."
0x70C2EC44

0xDB06C2B2
"His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?--priggish and
0x5B1211B6
parsonic?"
0xFE50916A

0xDB06C2B2
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they
0x74DF969D
must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike."
0x9C295113

0xDB06C2B2
"His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a
0x9AD030FD
sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
0x74E8F209
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"
0x675F89F4

0xDB06C2B2
"St. John dresses well.  He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue
0x2FDA821A
eyes, and a Grecian profile."
0xA83C3D36

0xDB06C2B2
(Aside.)  "Damn him!"--(To me.)  "Did you like him, Jane?"
0x0B75DD17

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before."
0xA9DF3DB8

0xDB06C2B2
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
0x1B77259D
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
0x17AB6C2E
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
0x29A60E2E
immediately charm the snake.
0xD828844B

0xDB06C2B2
"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was
0x3E0569E7
the next somewhat unexpected observation.
0x84FC0768

0xDB06C2B2
"Why not, Mr. Rochester?"
0x558153ED

0xDB06C2B2
"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
0x659987DD
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
0x3DBC3EA1
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
0x704916CA
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
0xC97994AD
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
0xDB8886E4
bargain."
0xFBCEE056

0xDB06C2B2
"I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan,
0x443CA11B
sir."
0xF96FEC4F

0xDB06C2B2
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
0xA83C9441
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
0x7B2D6589
question or two."  He paused.
0xCA4ADD16

0xDB06C2B2
"What questions, Mr. Rochester?"
0x9D2151FC

0xDB06C2B2
Then followed this cross-examination.
0xC94484A0

0xDB06C2B2
"St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his
0x71588066
cousin?"
0x1DC7E0BA

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
"You would often see him?  He would visit the school sometimes?"
0xDCFEDD92

0xDB06C2B2
"Daily."
0xF00390CE

0xDB06C2B2
"He would approve of your plans, Jane?  I know they would be clever, for
0xB1A8B936
you are a talented creature!"
0x31CFC5E6

0xDB06C2B2
"He approved of them--yes."
0xD0A442B4

0xDB06C2B2
"He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find?
0xA6DDDC7A
Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary."
0x84F19C3D

0xDB06C2B2
"I don't know about that."
0xF9CC19E9

0xDB06C2B2
"You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come
0xFBB99463
there to see you?"
0x47F1F066

0xDB06C2B2
"Now and then?"
0x99922457

0xDB06C2B2
"Of an evening?"
0x2EF7FD1C

0xDB06C2B2
"Once or twice."
0xEAACC0DA

0xDB06C2B2
A pause.
0x0246A264

0xDB06C2B2
"How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship
0x721EFEBD
was discovered?"
0x2709D187

0xDB06C2B2
"Five months."
0x27B24D9D

0xDB06C2B2
"Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?"
0x05BEEC81

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the
0x455B8CAD
window, and we by the table."
0x01FEA0A7

0xDB06C2B2
"Did he study much?"
0x9F5EF21A

0xDB06C2B2
"A good deal."
0x9F699B0A

0xDB06C2B2
"What?"
0xF668A3E1

0xDB06C2B2
"Hindostanee."
0x134A4E42

0xDB06C2B2
"And what did you do meantime?"
0x72E80377

0xDB06C2B2
"I learnt German, at first."
0xF2B0F4AB

0xDB06C2B2
"Did he teach you?"
0xF1103698

0xDB06C2B2
"He did not understand German."
0x72F8B5A4

0xDB06C2B2
"Did he teach you nothing?"
0x5358794C

0xDB06C2B2
"A little Hindostanee."
0x869048E5

0xDB06C2B2
"Rivers taught you Hindostanee?"
0xED56AB7C

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"And his sisters also?"
0xA418CBBE

0xDB06C2B2
"No."
0xBB39FC9B

0xDB06C2B2
"Only you?"
0xB16A9CF8

0xDB06C2B2
"Only me."
0xAFE4177F

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you ask to learn?"
0x42342613

0xDB06C2B2
"No."
0xBB39FC9B

0xDB06C2B2
"He wished to teach you?"
0x347933FF

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes."
0xFF410A9A

0xDB06C2B2
A second pause.
0x94A27D9D

0xDB06C2B2
"Why did he wish it?  Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?"
0x1CFB4BF0

0xDB06C2B2
"He intended me to go with him to India."
0x4346C3F4

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah! here I reach the root of the matter.  He wanted you to marry him?"
0xF6458E88

0xDB06C2B2
"He asked me to marry him."
0xCCE1C1DA

0xDB06C2B2
"That is a fiction--an impudent invention to vex me."
0x6AEE43EF

0xDB06C2B2
"I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once,
0x439F16A0
and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be."

"Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.  How often am I to say the
0x356A1DCC
same thing?  Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I
0xC944BF76
have given you notice to quit?"
0x1A593A05

0xDB06C2B2
"Because I am comfortable there."
0x818A9998

0xDB06C2B2
"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with
0xDB3B806A
me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I
0x6C810173
thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
0xCB747D46
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we
0x5E0C3C5B
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
0x758BA5AC
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is
0xEB3AD1BE
useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."
0x624CB71F

0xDB06C2B2
"Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own
0xD88F61C6
accord."
0x1B4DC953

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so
0xAAFB26D7
truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you
0x21354879
have formed a new tie.  But I am not a fool--go--"
0x02FB7616

0xDB06C2B2
"Where must I go, sir?"
0xDAB62629

0xDB06C2B2
"Your own way--with the husband you have chosen."
0x449ECA3B

0xDB06C2B2
"Who is that?"
0x468FB30E

0xDB06C2B2
"You know--this St. John Rivers."
0xEE9A7BD3

0xDB06C2B2
"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not
0x073D9288
love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
0x22DDAB9E
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
0x7401BC5B
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
0x1C69E30C
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
0x49E26FD6
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
0x94A90CFC
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
0x3B3EE645
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
0xBCD4794F
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
0xFCE25EDD

0xDB06C2B2
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
0x3912674F
beloved master.  He smiled.
0x6F9ECC98

0xDB06C2B2
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
0xFAF7C3EA
you and Rivers?"
0x8F09CDF5

0xDB06C2B2
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
0x3C73958A
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
0x5A312C8F
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
0x215823A7
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
0x1F1E9AC3
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
0x0EC31264
of me from your presence for ever."
0x1BEEA4AE

0xDB06C2B2
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
0xE57D9BED

0xDB06C2B2
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
0xBCC8E889

0xDB06C2B2
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
0x133214A3
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
0xF37EF570
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
0x13E16325
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
0x8A8FB6E7

0xDB06C2B2
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
0xCB6E7572
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
0xE3B4437C
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
0xBAD59B09

0xDB06C2B2
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
0x21923A5D
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
0x1D73AAA1
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
0xF31BA5B8
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
0xA2942FF1
offers them so safe a prop."
0x735A2A15

0xDB06C2B2
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
0x6180DDD5

0xDB06C2B2
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
0x59699740

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
0x9C7325AE
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
0x1EF65C3D
helped me.
0xF2A8C914

0xDB06C2B2
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."
0xAD7E8399

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you, sir?"
0x2AEB9773

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes: is it news to you?"
0x52628C1A

0xDB06C2B2
"Of course: you said nothing about it before."
0x20C31595

0xDB06C2B2
"Is it unwelcome news?"
0x0E83355F

0xDB06C2B2
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."
0xB425DF00

0xDB06C2B2
"Which you shall make for me, Jane.  I will abide by your decision."
0x1F416359

0xDB06C2B2
"Choose then, sir--_her who loves you best_."
0x6AC7FFF1

0xDB06C2B2
"I will at least choose--_her I love best_.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x38DA4138

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?"
0x4F0418BB

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait
0xEDC9CBE8
on?"
0xF423BA9E

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0xDB06C2B2
"Truly, Jane?"
0x578574A1

0xDB06C2B2
"Most truly, sir."
0xDCE4C59E

0xDB06C2B2
"Oh! my darling!  God bless you and reward you!"
0x301A4CCB

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life--if ever I thought a
0x4D10B352
good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I
0xA02000AA
wished a righteous wish,--I am rewarded now.  To be your wife is, for me,
0xB2A92CB9
to be as happy as I can be on earth."
0x7BE31A34

0xDB06C2B2
"Because you delight in sacrifice."
0x3ECE1178

0xDB06C2B2
"Sacrifice!  What do I sacrifice?  Famine for food, expectation for
0xFBB1F6A6
content.  To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my
0xED271BB8
lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a
0x664B2821
sacrifice?  If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice."
0x7B4CA54A

0xDB06C2B2
"And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies."
0x1E5697F6

0xDB06C2B2
"Which are none, sir, to me.  I love you better now, when I can really be
0xE784A5C8
useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you
0x4382F9F0
disdained every part but that of the giver and protector."
0x7DB5EA96

0xDB06C2B2
"Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I
0x78445377
shall hate it no more.  I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's,
0x610BD923
but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.  I
0xCA31F817
preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but
0x20AE0C96
Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.  Jane suits me: do I suit
0x7B7324A9
her?"
0x84393BF9

0xDB06C2B2
"To the finest fibre of my nature, sir."
0x206A67BC

0xDB06C2B2
"The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be
0xE4E3FAA1
married instantly."
0xFE46B592

0xDB06C2B2
He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.
0x91C0F8D7

0xDB06C2B2
"We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the
0x13DF87EF
licence to get--then we marry."
0x125D9194

0xDB06C2B2
"Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its
0xD0ED3C04
meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner.  Let me look at
0x1860F23D
your watch."
0x78231ED9

0xDB06C2B2
"Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no
0xF58ABBCE
use for it."
0x7EFECB23

0xDB06C2B2
"It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir.  Don't you feel
0x32D64CBD
hungry?"
0x80BDC106

0xDB06C2B2
"The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.  Never mind fine
0x840C5370
clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip."
0x0FEA6D95

0xDB06C2B2
"The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir.  The breeze is still: it
0x1D130603
is quite hot."
0xE4D532B1

0xDB06C2B2
"Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment
0x1B3B31C3
fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat?  I have worn it since the
0xCE3B66E8
day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her."
0xCBDF16A9

0xDB06C2B2
"We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way."
0xBDD73509

0xDB06C2B2
He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.
0xB0B4DD74

0xDB06C2B2
"Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
0x8FAB4812
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not
0x2784FB42
as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more
0xE3BF4C63
wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
0xB1EC0315
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
0x5AE1398F
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
0xE2DEA5F6
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
0xFA9BB8CE
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
0x6D49EEE9
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
0xEAAF50CF
humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it
0x8B31A32B
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
0xDC360A7A
weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and
0x87CEBC5F
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
0xE0951B21
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
0xB896A4CE
pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.
0xD69A2B3B

0xDB06C2B2
"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,
0xF7F9465F
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
0xC59D5604
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere
0xAC6A0AF6
find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between
0xBD4D8244
eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
0xB7F6C13B
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this
0xD4D5CF9C
life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
0xBB736C44
rejoining Jane.
0x0D88C2AD

0xDB06C2B2
"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
0xD8D5EEA8
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
0x37C1E530
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
0xDBD058F6
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
0xAEE7C28F
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
0x301626E6
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and
0xB3B71E2E
peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I
0x63F1180D
could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
0xA4D5F082
heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane!
0x8D504BA5
Jane!  Jane!'"
0x467DDF60

0xDB06C2B2
"Did you speak these words aloud?"
0xF7B1C8B7

0xDB06C2B2
"I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
0x94D5D43E
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."
0x14A273DB

0xDB06C2B2
"And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?"
0x2547B1AC

0xDB06C2B2
"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
0x40DDDB97
point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my
0xE56A6790
blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is
0x18FD1BA0
that I heard what I now relate.
0x0826BD33

0xDB06C2B2
"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the
0x8F817F43
voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
0x9D5F523B
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where
0x28C81F1B
are you?'
0x9BEF81D1

0xDB06C2B2
"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my
0x7162FBAC
mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is
0xAE1F2C1A
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
0xA22CFE61
unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I
0x4B394CD1
heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
0x051F12EE
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
0x432AAC61
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
0xC8D4ABD7
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
0xA8608BD1
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were
0x8788C567
your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!"
0xE557FF49

0xDB06C2B2
Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
0xF1C3B3C4
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
0xF583B8A8
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
0xCB048A02
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
0xCD7E4DC8
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
0x3CEB1989
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
0x6F66C4EC
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
0xC0FEFA0B
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
0x290A052B
them in my heart.
0x2C6F1A7E

0xDB06C2B2
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
0xAC1309F6
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
0x1540D463
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
0x2EC7BB58
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
0x1D868336
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank
0x9BAB291D
God!"
0x48749EEA

0xDB06C2B2
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
0x840BC95B
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
0x88C06426
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.
0x0427ED43

0xDB06C2B2
"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
0x28C557BC
mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
0x90F71A74
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"
0xBC7B34DD

0xDB06C2B2
Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
0xEB22ED01
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
0x97203A31
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
0x53F31E10
entered the wood, and wended homeward.
0x19EB6345

CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
0xF450DADB

0xDB06C2B2

0xDB06C2B2
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
0xE4B5F568
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
0x140417F2
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
0x9D210DB1
cleaning the knives, and I said--
0xE18A5DDD

0xDB06C2B2
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
0x5F63C46F
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
0xABE0D1B9
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
0x25A882A5
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
0x73C1412B
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
0xF7D4E3DE
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
0xA15157F9
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
0x1CCCFBC8
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
0xB6348694
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
0x32C5682E
again over the roast, said only--
0xCABA06D3

0xDB06C2B2
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
0x63E4B560

0xDB06C2B2
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
0xDACB55BB
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
0xEF2D9D3C
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
0xB0F81713

0xDB06C2B2
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
0x83362509
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
0xFF37C096
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
0xDA0616ED
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
0x2C67D6FE
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
0x7ADE608C
politely pulled his forelock.
0xD73C0F4F

0xDB06C2B2
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
0x4380934B
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
0x07823301
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
0xC4DDF382
caught the words--
0xDECBE036

0xDB06C2B2
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
0xE247BF75
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
0x1F5A7393
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
0xA038974A

0xDB06C2B2
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
0x7812146A
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
0x331F5CD8
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
0x9D00030C
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
0xA2E736AA

0xDB06C2B2
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
0x3881B4A1
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
0x9311EBBA
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
0x09DEB5D4
grave or mine."
0xEE777B00

0xDB06C2B2
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
0x64C6DDC6
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
0xDCE8F69E
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
0xF3CF0570
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
0xB4F1874A
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
0xE2606B3C
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
0xC187DE20
the world, and only mind earthly things.
0x88CE2A90

0xDB06C2B2
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
0x15401169
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
0xBCBFAA53
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
0xED7CD0C9
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
0x3E495096
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
0xD7C4B043
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
0x637DA983
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
0x24460D34
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband

needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
0xE04348B1
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
0x3D509E10
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
0x52FB7EE7
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
0xD8C54BBE
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
0x85FFD18F
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
0x47288C53
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
0xE89ECC3A
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
0x908E372B
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
0x23F84986
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.

My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
0x8AEDA937
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
0x17F7B9FD
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
0xBAFC39AD

0xDB06C2B2
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
0x380F5CD7
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
0x7C681F00
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
0x528013ED
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
0x8607A45D
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
0x66E57E45
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
0x0CDD2FA3
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
0xF380DBAB
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
0x4FA870FA
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
0x4CCEDDFB
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
0x66C6F7E5
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
0x89FB2AE3
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
0x1AA0426F
concord is the result.
0x8A4AEFEA

0xDB06C2B2
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
0x1E54DC55
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
0x42B4C872
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
0xEFAB92BC
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
0x2B8B9F39
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
0x4A79A912
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
0xB51549D1
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
0xC9803F6A
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
0xC7CC2855
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
0xDF1F983F
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
0xAEAEE88D
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
0x7E9EAA45
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
0x98DDF8F7
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
0xDF3F344E
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
0x7D6D9823
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
0x251D0540

0xDB06C2B2
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
0x795CDAED
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
0xE4A97909
glittering ornament round your neck?"
0xD25A5009

0xDB06C2B2
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
0x0BFCE9C0

0xDB06C2B2
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
0xD9F3C86C

0xDB06C2B2
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
0x7B079312

0xDB06C2B2
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
0xE88F7D49
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
0x8948575C
sure of it.
0x05F1AF0C

0xDB06C2B2
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
0x4F0B372C
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
0x4152D1BD
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
0x2F905659
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
0x9E255C16
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
0x16A9802A
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
0xF830F1F4
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
0x6C769A65
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
0xB7C00152

0xDB06C2B2
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
0x5F824644
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
0x736EF708
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
0x5E4B0848
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
0x703A1778
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
0xE31906B0
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
0x292DF112
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
0x37F6D852

0xDB06C2B2
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
0xB1CD292E
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
0x989BA157
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
0x2265589B
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
0x4D06DC6A
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
0x2E0FD55D
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
0x37E3966E
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
0x193F88A1
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
0x47BB9177
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
0x498DF3D2
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
0x9BAE0D10
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
0x02B0EFAC
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
0x4DAE5658
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
0xBC7908BE
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
0x5678884E
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
0x466AFB14

0xDB06C2B2
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
0x5060015C
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
0x244F792D
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
0xABA8D89E
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
0xE7CA5EDD
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
0x4F251523
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
0x9CBC49A9
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
0xB13E2DED
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
0x4B139261
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
0x170E2689
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
0x4ADB57A6

0xDB06C2B2
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
0x8D7364FE
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
0xA5EA4505
respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
0x5795F15F
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
0x93DCD825
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
0xCEB57E60
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
0xCCA73C83
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
0xC204CEC2
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
0xEEA06278
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
0xB8734956
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
0x7D7BFE9C
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
0xE45AB98D
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
0x87F393DE
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
0xB78ADD96
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
0xA5A6CC4D
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
0x38668403
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
0xFEE750A4
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
0xC32C78FA
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
0xF7D69B91
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

0xC05F576A

0xDB06C2B2
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
0x8D512DEB
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
0x4E8821CC
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
0x322D45E3
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
0x33D4AD66
people in all walks of life.
0xABC10C3B

0xDB06C2B2
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
0xC126335E
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
0xAF8E12D2
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
0x62D44E74
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
0x531C505A
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
0x9940D63B
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Literary Archive Foundation

0xDB06C2B2
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
0x90D51DDB
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
0x96D25B5B
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
0xB4BA5337
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
0xB733AABD
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
0xF0088124
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
0xCCB28D61
status with the IRS.
0x683EBDCB

0xDB06C2B2
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
0xF924D44F
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
0x4B5F445A
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
0xE2384545
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
0x2C36E3C6
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
0x2F24811C
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
0xBFC0B070
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
0xB0736793
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate
0xCC28082E

0xDB06C2B2
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
0xBEAC5F45
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
0x1FF0F7CA
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
0xB75FE050
approach us with offers to donate.

0xDB06C2B2
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
0x9509B94B
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
0x03D35E29
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared

0x1050911A

0xDB06C2B2
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
0x930D0989
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
0x44F4668E
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily

keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
